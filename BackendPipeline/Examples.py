    # Conference Room
    {"input": """
- Determine an appropriate conference room size to accommodate typical seating, a presentation area, and circulation space.
- Create a rectangular floor representing the conference room base.
- Create four walls around the floor, each wall with appropriate height.
- Add a large rectangular conference table centered in the room, sized to seat 12 people comfortably.
- Create 12 office chairs arranged evenly around the conference table, ensuring each chair faces the table and has enough space to be pulled out without collision.
- Place a large wall-mounted flat-screen display on one of the longer walls, centered and at a comfortable viewing height.
- Add a speakerphone or conference call device on the conference table, centered.
- Create a side cabinet or credenza along one short wall, for storage and placing presentation materials.
- Add a flipchart stand or whiteboard mounted on a side wall, with enough space around it for user access.
- Install adjustable ceiling lights evenly spaced above the conference table for optimal lighting.
- Place a few potted plants in corners to add greenery and decoration.
- Include a floor carpet or rug under the conference table and chairs to define the seating area.
- Paint walls in neutral light colors; color the floor with a complementary tone to create a professional atmosphere.
- Ensure there is clear walk space around the table and chairs for circulation without collisions.
- All furniture and devices should be placed on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.""",

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.""",

        "input": """
- Create a large rectangular playground area as the base floor.
- Place 2 slides at different spots within the playground. Design the slides with stair access leading to the slide platform. Slides should be child safe sized and placed on soft ground.
- Add 4 swings arranged in a row or a slight curve. Each swing consists of two poles holding the bar and the hanging seat. Swings should have enough spacing to avoid collisions.
- Create climbing structures consisting of platforms, ladders, and climbing nets or bars. Place the structures centrally so kids can reach them easily.
- Add 2 see-saws, positioned with enough room around for safe swinging.
- Build a sandpit in a corner or central spot, surrounded by a small edge to hold the sand. Include some small sand toys scattered in it.
- Arrange 5 benches evenly spaced at the edges of the playground for resting adults or supervisors.
- Plant 7 trees around the playground area providing shade but not obstructing play equipment.
- Add 3 creative "cool" playground elements, including:
  - A merry-go-round sized for kids, circular with hand bars.
  - A balance beam made with a smooth wooden plank slightly elevated above the ground.
  - A sensory play panel mounted on a frame with interactive kid-friendly elements like spinning parts, shapes, and textures.
- Ensure all objects are sized appropriately and positioned on the floor or mounted as needed.
- Leave enough safe walking and playing space between all objects with no collisions.
- Color the playground objects in bright and playful RGB colors suitable for kids.
- Make sure slides have stairs facing away from benches and trees to avoid congestion.
- Orient swings so that they do not hit the slide or benches when swinging.""",
