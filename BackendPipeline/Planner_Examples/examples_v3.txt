# Examples

# Example
User: I want to create a fair booth
Assistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?
User: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth
Assistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?
User: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.
Assistant:

from the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.
- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision
- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.
- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.
- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.
- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.
- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.
- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing
- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.
