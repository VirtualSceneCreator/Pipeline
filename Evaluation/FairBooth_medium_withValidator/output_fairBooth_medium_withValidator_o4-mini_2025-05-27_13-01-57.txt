The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a fair booth for a fair about cars.

   • DisplayStand_3
6. Install overhead spotlights (4 total) attached to an overhead frame or ceiling at positions above the car and display stands.
7. Add three chairs near the reception desk for visitors to sit, positioned in a small seating cluster to one side of the desk.
8. Include three signage/banner objects on interior walls for branding or car graphics:
   • Banner_NorthWall

I begin by anchoring a large rectangular floor centrally to define the exhibit area. Four walls wrap the perimeter—North at the back, South at the front (with a 2m entrance gap), and East/West on the sides. The demo car sits at the exact center of the floor. A reception desk is placed 1m inside the front entrance and aligned to the floor’s centerline. Three display stands form an equal-interval arc around the front quadrant of the car, maintaining clear 1m visitor pathways. Four spotlights hang near the ceiling above the demo car and each stand for uniform lighting. Three chairs cluster to one side of the reception desk, facing it. Finally, banners are mounted mid-height on the North, East, and West walls. All objects adhere to human-scale proportions, maintain at least 1m clearance, and avoid collisions.

[2025-05-27 12:55:49,392] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a rectangular floor area suitable to showcase a demo car with enough space to walk around it comfortably.
- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.
- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.
- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.
- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.
- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.
- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.
- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.
- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.
- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.
- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.

panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair

[2025-05-27 12:57:34,916] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a rectangular floor area suitable to showcase a demo car with enough space to walk around it comfortably.
- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.
- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.
- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.
- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.
- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.
- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.
- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.
- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.
- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.
- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.

floor area suitable to showcase a demo car with enough space to walk around it comfortably.\n- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.\n- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.\n- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.\n- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.\n- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'demo_car\', \'path\': \'DemoCarShowroom/objects/demo_car\',

[2025-05-27 12:58:21,176] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a rectangular floor area suitable to showcase a demo car with enough space to walk around it comfortably.
- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.
- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.
- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.
- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.
- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.
- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.
- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.
- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.
- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.
- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.

comfortably.\n- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.\n- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.\n- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.\n- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.\n- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs':

[2025-05-27 12:58:58,152] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a rectangular floor area suitable to showcase a demo car with enough space to walk around it comfortably.
- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.
- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.
- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.
- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.
- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.
- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.
- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.
- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.
- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.
- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.

comfortably.\n- Construct four surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.\n- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.\n- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.\n- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.\n- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs':

surrounding walls for the fair booth with a reasonable height to enclose the space.\n- Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.\n- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.\n- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.\n- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all additional items while allowing visitor movement around them.\n[Conversation finished]These are the

Place a demo car 3D model centered inside the fair booth on the floor, leaving ample space on all sides for visitors to view the car from all angles.\n- Add a reception desk near the entrance of the fair booth for welcoming visitors, positioned on the floor and appropriately sized for interaction.\n- Arrange three display stands around the demo car for showcasing car accessories or informational panels, placed on the floor without any collision.\n- Install overhead spotlights attached to the ceiling or an overhead frame to illuminate the demo car and highlight key display areas.\n- Add a few chairs or small seating areas near the reception desk for visitors to rest or converse.\n- Include signage or banners on the walls inside the fair booth with branding or car-related graphics to enhance the theme.\n- Make sure all objects are sized relative to each other and appropriately spaced with no collisions, providing clear pathways for walking.\n- Use colors appropriate for a car fair theme, such as metallic tones, black, and red accents to create a professional and attractive environment.\n- Ensure the fair booth is large enough to comfortably contain the demo car and all
