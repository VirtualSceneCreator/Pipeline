The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a fair booth for a fair about cars.

- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.

- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

The central car platform is aligned in the middle of the floor with the demo car elevated on it as the main attraction. A bold red reception desk sits at the front entrance, flanked by two tall branding banners. A large digital screen is mounted on the back wall for dynamic content. Two standing tables with paired bar stools on each side provide gathering spots, with stools facing their respective tables. Three bright white spotlights hang above the car platform to highlight the vehicle. Small potted plants occupy each corner to soften the space. All elements are spaced at least 50–150 cm apart to ensure clear walkways, and every object is either grounded or properly mounted.

[2025-05-27 12:54:21,142] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.
- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.
- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

The booth should be spacious and rectangular.\n- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.\n- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'booth_floor | position=(0,0,0), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(20,1,12), color=LightGray\', \'booth_wall_front | position=(0,2.05,-6), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(20,4,0.1), color=White\', \'booth_wall_back | position=(0,2.05,6), rotation=(0,180,0), scale=(20,4,0.1), color=White\', \'booth_wall_left | position=(-10,2.05,0), rotation=(0,90,0), scale=(12,4,0.1), color=White\', \'booth_wall_right | position=(10,2.05,0), rotation=(0,-90,0), scale=(12,4,0.1), color=White\', \'car_platform | position=(0,0.15,0), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(6,0.3,3), color=DarkGray\', \'demo_car | position=(0,0.45,0), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(1.8,1.4,4.5), color=ShinyMetallic(0.8,0.8,0.85)\', \'reception_desk | position=(0,0.55,-5.5), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(2,1.1,0.6), color=Red\', \'banner_left | position=(-5.5,1.25,-5.95), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(1,2.5,0.1), color=BrightBrandBlue\', \'banner_right | position=(5.5,1.25,-5.95), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(1,2.5,0.1), color=BrightBrandRed\', \'digital_screen | position=(0,2,5.95), rotation=(0,180,0), scale=(4,2.5,0.1), color=BlackFrame with ScreenTexture\', \'standing_table1 | position=(-4,0.55,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.8,1.1,0.8), color=DarkGray\', \'standing_table2 | position=(4,0.55,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.8,1.1,0.8), color=DarkGray\', \'bar_stool1 | position=(-4.5,0.525,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.5,1.05,0.5), color=Black\', \'bar_stool2 | position=(-3.5,0.525,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.5,1.05,0.5), color=Black\', \'bar_stool3 | position=(3.5,0.525,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.5,1.05,0.5), color=Black\', \'bar_stool4 | position=(4.5,0.525,2), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.5,1.05,0.5), color=Black\', \'spotlight1 | position=(-1,3.8,0), rotation=(90,0,0), scale=(0.3,0.3,0.3), color=White\', \'spotlight2 | position=(0,3.8,0), rotation=(90,0,0), scale=(0.3,0.3,0.3), color=White\', \'spotlight3 | position=(1,3.8,0), rotation=(90,0,0), scale=(0.3,0.3,0.3), color=White\', \'potted_plant1 | position=(-9.5,0.5,-9.5), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.4,1.0,0.4), color=Green\', \'potted_plant2 | position=(9.5,0.5,-9.5), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.4,1.0,0.4), color=Green\', \'potted_plant3 | position=(-9.5,0.5,9.5), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.4,1.0,0.4), color=Green\', \'potted_plant4 | position=(9.5,0.5,9.5), rotation=(0,0,0), scale=(0.4,1.0,0.4), color=Green\']\n            use these objects and their sizes [\'booth_floor\', \'booth_wall_front\', \'booth_wall_back\', \'booth_wall_left\', \'booth_wall_right\', \'car_platform\', \'demo_car\', \'reception_desk\', \'banner_left\', \'banner_right\', \'digital_screen\', \'standing_table1\', \'standing_table2\', \'bar_stool1\', \'bar_stool2\', \'bar_stool3\', \'bar_stool4\', \'spotlight1\', \'spotlight2\', \'spotlight3\', \'potted_plant1\', \'potted_plant2\', \'potted_plant3\', \'potted_plant4\']'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:57:24,354] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.
- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.
- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

the action plan:\n- Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably.

The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:58:09,843] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.
- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.
- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

the action plan:\n- Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.\n- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.\n- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 13:00:45,994] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.
- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.
- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'demo_car\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/vehicles/demo_car\', \'issue\': \'Demo car is intersecting the platform and is currently facing away from visitors entering from the front.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position to {x:0.0, y:1.0, z:0.0} so the car sits fully on top of the platform (platform top = 0.3, car half-height = 0.7) and change rotation to {x:0.0, y:180.0, z:0.0} so its front faces the entrance.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_left\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/branding/banner_left\', \'issue\': \'Banner is partially embedded in the front wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -5.90 (was -5.95) so the back face of the banner is flush with the interior surface of the front wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_right\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/branding/banner_right\', \'issue\': \'Banner is partially embedded in the front wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -5.90 (was -5.95) so the back face of the banner is flush with the interior surface of the front wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'digital_screen\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/display/digital_screen\', \'issue\': \'Digital screen is partially embedded in the back wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to 6.00 (was 5.95) so the front face of the screen is flush with the interior surface of the back wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bar_stool1\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/furniture/bar_stool1\', \'issue\': \'Bar stool 1 is intersecting with the standing table.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to -5.05 (was -4.5) to clear the table; keep y=0.525 and z=4.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bar_stool2\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/furniture/bar_stool2\', \'issue\': \'Bar stool 2 is intersecting with the standing table.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to -2.95 (was -3.5) to clear the table; keep y=0.525 and z=4.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bar_stool3\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/furniture/bar_stool3\', \'issue\': \'Bar stool 3 is intersecting with the standing table.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to 2.95 (was 3.5) to clear the table; keep y=0.525 and z=4.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bar_stool4\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/furniture/bar_stool4\', \'issue\': \'Bar stool 4 is intersecting with the standing table.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to 5.05 (was 4.5) to clear the table; keep y=0.525 and z=4.0.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 13:01:22,188] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine a fair booth size suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.
- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.
- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.
- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.
- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.
- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair's branding and car-related graphics.
- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.
- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.
- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.
- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.
- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.
- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair's branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.
- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.\n- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.\n- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.\n- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.\n- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

suitable for showcasing a demo car with enough space around for visitors to walk comfortably. The booth should be spacious and rectangular.\n- Create the fair booth with four walls and a floor, using neutral colors such as light gray for the floor and white for the walls.\n- Create one demo car model placed on the floor in the center of the fair booth. The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'digital_screen\', \'path\': \'DemoCarExhibitionBooth/objects/digital_screen\', \'issue\': \'Digital screen is intersecting with the back wall thickness (both are 0.1m thick), resulting in overlapping geometry inside the wall volume.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust the screen’s Z position from 6.00 to 5.90 so its front face (at Z=5.85) sits flush to the interior wall face and the model no longer collides with the wall.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

The car should be sized proportionally to the booth to stand out as the main attraction.\n- Add a raised platform or stage for the demo car to stand on, elevating the car slightly above the floor level.\n- Create a reception desk at the entrance of the fair booth for visitor inquiries, positioned near the front and colored in a complementary bold color like red.\n- Add two tall vertical banners on each side of the booth entrance with the fair\'s branding and car-related graphics.\n- Create a couple of standing tables with bar stools around them for visitors to gather and discuss.\n- Install overhead lighting above the demo car platform—spotlights or hanging lights in bright white for emphasis.\n- Place decorative elements such as small potted plants or automotive-themed ornaments in the corners of the booth.\n- Design a large digital screen on one wall to display car features, videos, or promotional content.\n- Ensure all objects have sufficient spacing to allow comfortable walking paths and no collision between them.\n- Assign colors to the main objects: demo car in a shiny metallic RGB tone, banners with bright colors matching the fair\'s branding, reception desk in red, tables and stools in dark gray/black, lighting fixtures in white/yellow glow, and potted plants in natural green.\n- Ensure all objects are placed on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as
