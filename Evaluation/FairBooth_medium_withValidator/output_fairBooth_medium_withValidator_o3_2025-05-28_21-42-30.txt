The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a fair booth for a fair about cars.

[2025-05-28 21:33:58,158] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.
- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth's enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.
- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.
- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.
- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.
- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.
- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.
- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.
- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.
- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.

fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth\'s enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.\n- Place a demo car model

[2025-05-28 21:34:28,240] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.
- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth's enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.
- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.
- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.
- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.
- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.
- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.
- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.
- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.
- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.

fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth\'s enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.\n- Place a demo car model

[2025-05-28 21:36:08,403] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.
- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth's enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.
- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.
- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.
- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.
- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.
- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.
- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.
- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.
- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.

fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth\'s enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.\n- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.\n- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.\n- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.\n- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.\n- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.\n- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.\n- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.\n- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_south\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_south\', \'issue\': \'Wall is centered at z = -10.0, causing half of its thickness to extend beyond the floor boundary rather than being flush with the floor edge.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.z from -10.0 to -9.9 so the inner face of the wall aligns exactly with the floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_north\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_north\', \'issue\': \'Wall is centered at z = 10.0, causing half of its thickness to extend beyond the floor boundary rather than being flush with the floor edge.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.z from 10.0 to 9.9 so the inner face of the wall aligns exactly with the floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_east\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_east\', \'issue\': \'Wall is centered at x = 10.0, causing half of its thickness to extend beyond the floor boundary rather than being flush with the floor edge.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.x from 10.0 to 9.9 so the inner face of the wall aligns exactly with the floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_west\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_west\', \'issue\': \'Wall is centered at x = -10.0, causing half of its thickness to extend beyond the floor boundary rather than being flush with the floor edge.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.x from -10.0 to -9.9 so the inner face of the wall aligns exactly with the floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'demo_car\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/demo_car\', \'issue\': \'Demo car is partially intersecting the floor (bottom at y = -0.75).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.y = 0.75 so the car sits flush on top of the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'display_rack1\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/display_rack1\', \'issue\': \'Display rack bottom is intersecting the floor (center y = 1.0, bottom at y = -0.10).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.y = 1.10 (half of rack height) so the rack rests flush on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'display_rack2\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/display_rack2\', \'issue\': \'Display rack bottom is intersecting the floor (center y = 1.0, bottom at y = -0.10).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.y = 1.10 so the rack rests flush on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'registration_desk\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/registration_desk\', \'issue\': \'Registration desk is intersecting the front (south) wall by 0.1 units (front face at z = -10.0 overlaps wall).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.z = -9.4 so the desk sits just inside the booth without colliding with the wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_back1\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/banner_back1\', \'issue\': \'Back banner is slightly intersecting the north wall (center z = 9.9, extents overlap wall).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.z = 9.80 so the banner sits flush inside the booth without collision.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_back2\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/banner_back2\', \'issue\': \'Back banner is slightly intersecting the north wall (center z = 9.9, extents overlap wall).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.z = 9.80 so the banner sits flush inside the booth without collision.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_front_corner1\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/banner_front_corner1\', \'issue\': \'Front-corner banner shares floor footprint with a potted plant and its lower portion collides at y ≤ 1.2.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.y = 3.0 to hang it near the ceiling (center y = 3.0) and clear the plant below.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'banner_front_corner2\', \'path\': \'VehicleShowroomBooth/banner_front_corner2\', \'issue\': \'Front-corner banner shares floor footprint with a potted plant and its lower portion collides at y ≤ 1.2.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.y = 3.0 to hang it near the ceiling (center y = 3.0) and clear the plant below.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-28 21:37:05,521] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.
- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth's enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.
- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.
- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.
- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.
- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.
- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.
- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.
- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.
- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.

freely without collision.\n- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.\n- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.\n- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.\n- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.\n- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.\n- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.\n- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

was the action plan:\n- Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth\'s enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.\n- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around

shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.\n- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.\n- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.\n- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.\n- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.\n- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-28 21:39:14,417] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.
- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth's enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.
- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.
- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.
- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.
- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.
- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.
- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.
- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.
- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.

was the action plan:\n- Create a large fair booth with a square floor layout, big enough to comfortably fit a demo car and additional objects without crowding.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to form the booth\'s enclosure; each wall touching the edges of the floor.\n- Place a demo car model centered on the floor inside the fair booth with enough space around it for visitors to walk around freely without collision.\n- Add a rectangular registration desk near the entrance of the booth at the front wall.\n- Create two sets of display shelves on either side of the demo car, each with three shelves for brochures or car accessories. These should be placed on the floor, with enough space between shelves and the demo car.\n- Position four tall vertical banners featuring car brand logos or promotional graphics; place two banners inside the booth at the back wall and two more suspended from the ceiling near the front corners.\n- Install ceiling-mounted spotlights above the demo car to highlight it.\n- Add two visitor seating areas with small round tables and four chairs each, placed towards the front corners of the booth with enough walking space.\n- Scatter some decorative potted plants in the corners for ambiance.\n- Ensure all objects have proper scaling and orientation, with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'registration_desk\', \'path\': \'registration_desk\', \'issue\': \'Registration desk intersects with the south wall (overlap of ~0.1m).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move registration_desk inward along Z by +0.1.
