The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a fair booth.

We begin by anchoring the floor at the center of the scene, then place the three walls flush against it at the left, back, and right sides. Next, we position the counter desk at the front entrance, aligned to the room’s center. Behind it, two display shelves are set along the back wall. In the middle area, four product tables form a square grid around the room center, each on the floor. We add two stools per table on opposite sides, all facing their respective tables. A hanging banner is centered at ceiling height, with three spotlights evenly spaced along the x-axis just below the ceiling. Finally, we place three potted plants near the side walls for decoration. Throughout, we use global constraints to anchor objects to room regions, position constraints for precise spatial relations, alignment for symmetry, and height constraints to reflect ground or top placements.

[2025-05-28 21:54:27,258] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a square fair booth floor with a size of 6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.
- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.',

- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

with a size of 6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.',

[2025-05-28 21:57:00,581] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a square fair booth floor with a size of 6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.
- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'stool1\', \'path\': \'CompactProductBooth/objects/stool1\', \'issue\': \'Stool is facing away from its table; it

[2025-05-28 21:58:01,274] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Create a square fair booth floor with a size of 6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.
- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

light brown RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model':

[2025-05-28 21:58:19,973] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Create a square fair booth floor with a size of 6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.
- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

light brown RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model':

- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.
- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.
- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.
- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.
- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.
- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.
- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.
- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.
- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.
- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.
- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.

RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter desk faces the entrance.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue

6 meters by 6 meters, made from a wooden texture, colored in a light brown RGB tone.\n- Construct three walls surrounding the floor on three sides (left, back, right) each wall 3 meters high and 6 meters long, colored in a clean white RGB tone.\n- Leave the front side open for visitors to enter.\n- Place a large rectangular counter desk at the front center entrance, size 2 meters long, 0.8 meters wide, and 1.2 meters high, colored in a dark wood tone.\n- Create two tall display shelves behind the counter, each 1.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep and 2 meters high, evenly spaced along the back wall, with bright RGB colors to attract attention.\n- Add four product display tables inside the booth, each table 1 meter square with rounded corners and 0.7 meters high, placed in a square arrangement in the booth center, colored with a sleek metallic tone.\n- Position 8 stools around the display tables, two per table, stools height 0.6 meters, colored in matching wood tones, all facing the tables.\n- Incorporate a hanging banner above the center of the booth, using thin elongated rectangles in vibrant RGB colors, suspended at 3 meters height from the floor.\n- Install three ceiling spotlights evenly spaced inside the booth, hanging from an invisible ceiling scaffold, colored warm yellow RGB.\n- Scatter decorative potted plants (3 cubes with plant textures and green color) near the two side walls to add freshness.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space around the counter, shelves, tables, and stools with no collisions.\n- Make sure all stools face their tables and counter
