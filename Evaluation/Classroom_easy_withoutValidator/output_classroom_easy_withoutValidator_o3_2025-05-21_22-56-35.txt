The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5.

[2025-05-21 22:51:38,598] INFO: Result:  To design this classroom, I anchor the floor centrally and frame the space with walls on each side. Front-wall features—the large window, curtains, and whiteboard—are mounted at the front, with the ceiling projector positioned above and facing the board. Six ceiling lights hang in a grid for even illumination. Bookshelves and a clock occupy the left wall, while posters decorate both the back and left walls. The teacher’s desk and chair sit center-front, oriented toward the whiteboard, with waste bins and a potted plant nearby for functionality and ambiance. Student desks and chairs fill the middle in three aligned rows, each chair placed just in front of its desk and facing the teacher.

Front-wall features—the large window, curtains, and whiteboard—are mounted at the front, with the ceiling projector positioned above and facing the board. Six ceiling lights hang in a grid for even illumination. Bookshelves and a clock occupy the left wall, while posters decorate both the back and left walls. The teacher’s desk and chair sit center-front, oriented toward the whiteboard, with waste bins and a potted plant nearby for functionality and ambiance. Student desks and chairs fill the middle in three aligned rows, each chair placed just in front of its desk and facing the teacher.\n\nfloor | middle  \nwallFront | front  \nwallBack | back

Each desk will be a rectangular table with a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher’s desk at the front center of the room, slightly larger than the student desks, with a comfortable chair facing the student desks.\n- Add a rectangular whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher’s desk.\n- Mount a ceiling projector aligned with the whiteboard above the teacher\'s area.\n- Place bookshelves along one side wall with varied heights and books arranged neatly.\n- Include a wall clock above one of the bookshelves in a visible location.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights, evenly spaced across the room to provide ample lighting.\n- Create several educational posters and charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Put a potted plant in one corner to add some greenery.\n- Position two waste bins, one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the room.\n- Color student desks in a light wood tone, teacher’s desk in a richer wood tone, chairs in a complementary color such as blue or green.\n- Use a light, neutral color for the walls and floor to maintain a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front of the classroom and
