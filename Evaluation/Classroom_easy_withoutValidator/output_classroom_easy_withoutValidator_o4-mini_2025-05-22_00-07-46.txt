The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

I’ve anchored on a standard student desk of 1.2 m width × 0.6 m depth × 0.75 m height, with chairs of 0.5 m square. To fit 5 desks side-by-side, I allow 1 m side aisles:  
• Room width = 5×1.2 m + 2×1 m = 8 m.  

For 3 rows front-to-back, I pair each desk depth (0.6 m) with a 1.2 m walkway for chair pull-out and circulation:  
• Row footprint = 0.6 m + 1.2 m = 1.8 m; 3 rows = 5.4 m  
• Plus 1.5 m front aisle + 1.5 m rear aisle = 3 m  
• Room depth ≈ 8.4 m, rounded to 8.5 m.  

Classroom height is set to 3 m. The teacher desk is larger (1.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 m) with a slightly larger chair. Fixtures (whiteboard, shelves, window, etc.) use typical classroom scales. Walls are 0.1 m thick, 3 m tall; floor is 0.1 m thick. All dimensions in meters.

[2025-05-22 00:00:03,702] INFO: Result:  I begin by anchoring the scene with the floor at the center, then erecting the four walls at the room’s edges. The teacher’s desk and chair go near the front wall, oriented toward the class. Behind them, student desks form a 3×5 grid in the middle of the room, each paired with a chair positioned about 0.75 m behind and facing its desk. The whiteboard mounts centrally on the front wall with the projector just above it. Along the right wall sits the bookshelf; the clock hangs on the left wall; a potted plant occupies the back-left corner. Six ceiling lights are arranged in two offset rows overhead. Four posters line the back and left walls, and waste bins sit near the front and back walls. Finally, a window and matching curtains occupy the right wall—all chairs face the front, and materials are chosen for light and complementary wood tones.

The values must stay the same! For example position, rotation, dimensions ... MUST stay the same!\n- Try to create objectGroups, to group the objects in the json.\n- Fill the specification field. Write multiple long sentences, that will be forwarded to an \'3D Object Generator\'. The\n3D Object Generator will receive the specification field and creates a 3D Asset with your specification. Be as detailed as possible\nfor the specification. Use the styles as described in the action plan!\n- Create the same specification for the same types of items. For example: all student chairs are the same.\n- Dont write any coordinates or relations into the specification, only a visual description of the object should be in the specification!\n- Only use the valid json schema, see Examples. If there are any calculations or different json objects, convert them\ninto the valid schema.\n- Only return the filled json, nothing else!\n\n# Json schema\n{\n  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",\n  "$id": "http://example.com/my-3d-meta-language.schema.json",\n  "type": "object",\n  "title": "3D Scene Schema",\n  "description": "Beschreibung einer 3D-Szene mit Top-Level- und Kind-Objekten, Umgebungsinformationen und Objektgruppen.",\n  "additionalProperties": false,\n  "properties": {\n    "scene": {\n      "type": "object",\n      "description": "Haupteintrag für die Szene",\n      "additionalProperties": false,\n      "required": [\n        "sceneName",\n        "environment",\n        "objects"\n      ],\n      "properties": {\n        "sceneName": {\n          "type": "string",\n          "description": "Name oder Bezeichner der Szene"\n        },\n        "environment": {\n          "$ref": "#/definitions/environment",\n          "description": "Umgebungsinformationen (z.\u202fB. indoor, outdoor, Dimensionen)"\n        },\n        "objectGroups": {\n          "type": "object",\n          "description": "Liste der Objektgruppen mit spezifischen Farbeinstellungen.
