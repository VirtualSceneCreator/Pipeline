The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

[2025-05-20 15:19:54,276] INFO: Input:  Overall Plan for Classroom Scene:

1. Determine overall classroom dimensions:
   - Spacious enough for 15 student desks in 3 rows of 5, teacher’s desk area, walking aisles, furniture, and decorative elements.
   - Estimate an initial room size around 10m (length) x 7m (width) x 3m (height).

2. Enumerate all GameObjects to be created:
   - 15 Student Desks (rectangular tables)
   - 15 Student Chairs
   - 1 Teacher Desk (large, darker wood tone)
   - 1 Teacher Chair (comfortable)
   - 1 Whiteboard/Blackboard (large rectangle)
   - 1 Ceiling Projector
   - 2 Bookshelves (tall, filled with books)
   - 1 Wall Clock (circular)
   - 2 Potted Plants
   - 4 Ceiling Lights (rectangular)
   - 6 Educational Posters/Charts
   - 3 Waste Bins
   - 1 Large Window with Curtains
   - 4 Walls
   - 1 Floor (flat plane)

3. Define spatial zones and buffer spaces:
   - Student area: center of room, desks in 3 rows of 5, chairs behind each desk. Allow at least 1m walkway between rows and around perimeter.
   - Teacher area: front center of room, teacher desk and chair facing student rows, whiteboard above teacher desk on front wall, projector centered on ceiling aligned to whiteboard.
   - Storage area: one side wall for bookshelves, opposite side wall for window and curtains; posters on back and side walls.
   - Decorative: potted plants in front-left and back-right corners; clock on side wall opposite bookshelves; waste bins: one near teacher desk, two at back corners.
   - Lighting: four rectangular ceiling lights evenly distributed in ceiling grid.

4. Material and color scheme:
   - Student desks: light wood tone
   - Student chairs: complementary shade color
   - Teacher desk: darker wood tone
   - Teacher chair: matching dark tone
   - Walls and floor: white or pastel
   - Other objects colored realistically (black projector, whiteboard, green plants, brown bookshelves)

5. Outputs expected from module:
   - Precise dimensions (width, depth, height) for each object and room
   - Validation that the chosen room size can accommodate all objects with required clearances

Next steps after sizing:
   a. Call relation_module to establish spatial relations (e.g., "Desk1 in Row1, Column1 at coordinates (x,y)").
   b. Call object_placement_module with final dimensions and relations to instantiate GameObjects.

Please provide a detailed list of each GameObject’s size based on this plan.

[2025-05-20 15:21:46,446] INFO: Result:  I’m anchoring the scale on a standard teacher desk (1.6 m wide) to set the classroom grid. Student desks are sized at 1 m wide so that five fit within a 7 m interior width with ≥1 m clearances along both sides. Desk depths of 0.6 m and heights of 0.75 m give ample legroom. Chairs follow ergonomic norms (seat height ~0.45 m), with student chairs at 0.45 m wide × 0.5 m deep × 0.9 m tall and a slightly larger teacher chair at 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1.1 m. Bookshelves at 0.8 m × 0.3 m × 2 m occupy one side wall, with a 1.5 m × 1.2 m × 0.1 m window opposite. A 2 m × 1.2 m × 0.05 m whiteboard spans the front wall above the teacher desk; the ceiling grid holds four 1 m × 0.2 m × 0.1 m lights and a 0.4 m × 0.3 m × 0.15 m projector. Decorative posters (0.6 m × 0.8 m × 0.02 m), a 0.4 m diameter clock, two potted plants (0.4 m × 0.4 m × 1.2 m) and three 0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.5 m bins round out the plan. Walls are 3 m tall with 0.1 m thickness; the floor plane spans 10 m × 7 m × 0.1 m, ensuring all elements fit with ≥1 m aisles.

Student desks are sized at 1 m wide so that five fit within a 7 m interior width with ≥1 m clearances along both sides. Desk depths of 0.6 m and heights of 0.75 m give ample legroom. Chairs follow ergonomic norms (seat height ~0.45 m), with student chairs at 0.45 m wide × 0.5 m deep × 0.9 m tall and a slightly larger teacher chair at 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1.1 m. Bookshelves at 0.8 m × 0.3 m × 2 m occupy one side wall, with a 1.5 m × 1.2 m × 0.1 m window opposite. A 2 m × 1.2 m × 0.05 m whiteboard spans the front wall above the teacher desk; the ceiling grid holds four 1 m × 0.2 m × 0.1 m lights and a 0.4 m × 0.3 m × 0.15 m projector. Decorative posters (0.6 m × 0.8 m × 0.02 m), a 0.4 m diameter clock, two potted plants (0.4 m × 0.4 m × 1.2 m) and three 0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.5 m bins round out the plan.

I begin by establishing the floor as the foundational anchor and then position the four walls at the room’s perimeter. With the boundaries set, I place the teacher desk centrally at the front wall and position the teacher chair behind it. Next, I layout the fifteen student desks in three rows of five, spacing them evenly from the back wall toward the teacher desk and aligning the first and last columns near the side walls. Each desk receives a matching chair placed directly in front, facing the desk. The whiteboard and ceiling projector mount on the front wall above the teacher area. Along the left wall, two bookshelves are set, balanced by a curtained window on the right wall. A wall clock and educational posters decorate the side and back walls. Waste bins and potted plants anchor the room’s corners and the side of the teacher desk. Finally, four ceiling lights form a 2×2 grid at the ceiling. Each placement depends only on previously placed objects, and same-type items maintain consistent alignment.

Student desks are sized at 1 m wide so that five fit within a 7 m interior width with ≥1 m clearances along both sides. Desk depths of 0.6 m and heights of 0.75 m give ample legroom. Chairs follow ergonomic norms (seat height ~0.45 m), with student chairs at 0.45 m wide × 0.5 m deep × 0.9 m tall and a slightly larger teacher chair at 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1.1 m. Bookshelves at 0.8 m × 0.3 m × 2 m occupy one side wall, with a 1.5 m × 1.2 m × 0.1 m window opposite. A 2 m × 1.2 m × 0.05 m whiteboard spans the front wall above the teacher desk; the ceiling grid holds four 1 m × 0.2 m × 0.1 m lights and a 0.4 m × 0.3 m × 0.15 m projector. Decorative posters (0.6 m × 0.8 m × 0.02 m), a 0.4 m diameter clock, two potted plants (0.4 m × 0.4 m × 1.2 m) and three 0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.5 m bins round out the plan. Walls are 3 m tall with 0.1 m thickness; the floor plane spans 10 m × 7 m × 0.1 m, ensuring all elements fit with ≥1 m aisles.  \n\n{"name": "teacher_desk", "size": { "width": 1.6, "height": 0.75,

Each desk receives a matching chair placed directly in front, facing the desk. The whiteboard and ceiling projector mount on the front wall above the teacher area. Along the left wall, two bookshelves are set, balanced by a curtained window on the right wall. A wall clock and educational posters decorate the side and back walls.

[2025-05-20 15:25:19,440] INFO: Input Action Plan:  Overall Plan for Classroom Scene:

1. Determine overall classroom dimensions:
   - Spacious enough for 15 student desks in 3 rows of 5, teacher’s desk area, walking aisles, furniture, and decorative elements.
   - Estimate an initial room size around 10m (length) x 7m (width) x 3m (height).

2. Enumerate all GameObjects to be created:
   - 15 Student Desks (rectangular tables)
   - 15 Student Chairs
   - 1 Teacher Desk (large, darker wood tone)
   - 1 Teacher Chair (comfortable)
   - 1 Whiteboard/Blackboard (large rectangle)
   - 1 Ceiling Projector
   - 2 Bookshelves (tall, filled with books)
   - 1 Wall Clock (circular)
   - 2 Potted Plants
   - 4 Ceiling Lights (rectangular)
   - 6 Educational Posters/Charts
   - 3 Waste Bins
   - 1 Large Window with Curtains
   - 4 Walls
   - 1 Floor (flat plane)

3. Define spatial zones and buffer spaces:
   - Student area: center of room, desks in 3 rows of 5, chairs behind each desk. Allow at least 1m walkway between rows and around perimeter.
   - Teacher area: front center of room, teacher desk and chair facing student rows, whiteboard above teacher desk on front wall, projector centered on ceiling aligned to whiteboard.
   - Storage area: one side wall for bookshelves, opposite side wall for window and curtains; posters on back and side walls.
   - Decorative: potted plants in front-left and back-right corners; clock on side wall opposite bookshelves; waste bins: one near teacher desk, two at back corners.
   - Lighting: four rectangular ceiling lights evenly distributed in ceiling grid.

4. Material and color scheme:
   - Student desks: light wood tone
   - Student chairs: complementary shade color
   - Teacher desk: darker wood tone
   - Teacher chair: matching dark tone
   - Walls and floor: white or pastel
   - Other objects colored realistically (black projector, whiteboard, green plants, brown bookshelves)

5. Instantiate all GameObjects in the Unity scene using the provided sizes and relations.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

Determine overall classroom dimensions:\n   - Spacious enough for 15 student desks in 3 rows of 5, teacher’s desk area, walking aisles, furniture, and decorative elements.\n   - Estimate an initial room size around 10m (length) x 7m (width) x 3m (height).\n\n2. Enumerate all GameObjects to be created:\n   - 15 Student Desks (rectangular tables)\n   - 15 Student Chairs\n   - 1 Teacher Desk (large, darker wood tone)\n   - 1 Teacher Chair (comfortable)\n   - 1 Whiteboard/Blackboard (large rectangle)\n   - 1 Ceiling Projector\n   - 2 Bookshelves (tall, filled with books)\n   - 1 Wall Clock (circular)\n   - 2 Potted Plants\n   - 4 Ceiling Lights (rectangular)\n   - 6 Educational Posters/Charts\n   - 3 Waste Bins\n   - 1 Large Window with Curtains\n   - 4 Walls\n   - 1 Floor (flat plane)\n\n3. Define spatial zones and buffer spaces:\n   - Student area: center of room, desks in 3 rows of 5, chairs behind each desk. Allow at least 1m walkway between rows and around perimeter.\n   - Teacher area: front center of room, teacher desk and chair facing student rows, whiteboard above teacher desk on front wall, projector centered on ceiling aligned to whiteboard.\n   - Storage area: one side wall for bookshelves, opposite side wall for window and curtains; posters on back and side walls.\n   - Decorative: potted plants in front-left and back-right corners; clock on side wall opposite bookshelves; waste bins: one near teacher desk, two at back corners.\n   - Lighting: four rectangular ceiling lights evenly distributed in ceiling grid.\n\n4. Material and color scheme:\n   - Student desks: light wood tone\n   - Student chairs: complementary shade color\n   - Teacher desk: darker wood tone\n   - Teacher chair: matching dark tone\n   - Walls and floor: white or pastel\n   - Other objects colored realistically (black projector, whiteboard, green plants, brown bookshelves)\n\n5. Instantiate all GameObjects in the Unity scene using the provided sizes and relations.\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor | middle | ground\', \'wall_front | front\',

With the boundaries set, I place the teacher desk centrally at the front wall and position the teacher chair behind it. Next, I layout the fifteen student desks in three rows of five, spacing them evenly from the back wall toward the teacher desk and aligning the first and last columns near the side walls. Each desk receives a matching chair placed directly in front, facing the desk. The whiteboard and ceiling projector mount on the front wall above the teacher area. Along the left wall, two bookshelves are set, balanced by a curtained window on the right wall. A wall clock and educational posters decorate the side and back walls. Waste bins and potted plants anchor the room’s corners and the side of the teacher desk. Finally, four ceiling lights form a 2×2 grid at the ceiling. Each placement depends only on previously placed objects, and same-type items maintain consistent alignment.\n\nfloor | middle | ground\nwall_front | front\nwall_back | back\nwall_left | side,left\nwall_right | side,right\nteacher_desk | front | center aligned, wall_front | ground\nteacher_chair | front | center aligned, teacher_desk | ground | in front of, teacher_desk | face to, teacher_desk\nstudent_desk1 | side,left | ground | near, wall_back | in front of, wall_back\nstudent_desk2 | middle | ground | near, wall_back | in front of, wall_back\nstudent_desk3 | middle | ground | near, wall_back | in front of, wall_back\nstudent_desk4 | middle | ground | near, wall_back | in front of, wall_back\nstudent_desk5 | side,right | ground | near, wall_back | in front of, wall_back\nstudent_desk6 | side,left | ground | far, student_desk1 | in front of, student_desk1\nstudent_desk7 | middle | ground | far, student_desk2 | in front of, student_desk2\nstudent_desk8 | middle | ground | far, student_desk3 | in front of, student_desk3\nstudent_desk9 | middle | ground | far, student_desk4 | in front of, student_desk4\nstudent_desk10 | side,right | ground | far, student_desk5 | in front of, student_desk5\nstudent_desk11 | side,left | ground | far, student_desk6 | in front of, student_desk6\nstudent_desk12 | middle | ground | far, student_desk7 | in front of, student_desk7\nstudent_desk13 | middle | ground | far, student_desk8 | in front of, student_desk8\nstudent_desk14 | middle | ground | far, student_desk9 | in front of, student_desk9\nstudent_desk15 | side,right | ground | far, student_desk10 | in front of, student_desk10\nstudent_chair1 | side,left | ground | near, student_desk1 | in front of, student_desk1 | face to, student_desk1\nstudent_chair2 | middle | ground | near, student_desk2 | in front of, student_desk2 | face to, student_desk2\nstudent_chair3 | middle | ground | near, student_desk3 | in front of, student_desk3 | face to, student_desk3\nstudent_chair4 | middle | ground | near, student_desk4 | in front of, student_desk4 | face to, student_desk4\nstudent_chair5 | side,right | ground | near, student_desk5 | in front of, student_desk5 | face to, student_desk5\nstudent_chair6 | side,left | ground | near, student_desk6 | in front of, student_desk6 | face to, student_desk6\nstudent_chair7 | middle | ground | near, student_desk7 | in front of, student_desk7 | face to, student_desk7\nstudent_chair8 | middle | ground | near, student_desk8 | in front of, student_desk8 | face to, student_desk8\nstudent_chair9 | middle | ground | near, student_desk9 | in front of, student_desk9 | face to, student_desk9\nstudent_chair10 | side,right | ground | near, student_desk10 | in front of, student_desk10 | face to, student_desk10\nstudent_chair11 | side,left | ground | near, student_desk11 | in front of, student_desk11 | face to, student_desk11\nstudent_chair12 | middle | ground | near, student_desk12 | in front of, student_desk12 | face to, student_desk12\nstudent_chair13 | middle | ground | near, student_desk13 | in front of, student_desk13 | face to, student_desk13\nstudent_chair14 | middle | ground | near, student_desk14 | in front of, student_desk14 | face to, student_desk14\nstudent_chair15 | side,right | ground | near, student_desk15 | in front of, student_desk15 | face to, student_desk15\nwhiteboard | front | side of, wall_front | above, teacher_desk | center aligned, teacher_desk | air\nceiling_projector | front | center aligned, teacher_desk | top\nbookshelf1 | side,left | side of, wall_left | ground\nbookshelf2 | side,left | side of, wall_left | ground\nwindow_with_curtains | side,right | side of, wall_right | air\nwall_clock | side,right | side of, wall_right | air\neducational_poster1 | back | side of, wall_back | air\neducational_poster2 | back | side of, wall_back | air\neducational_poster3 | back | side of, wall_back | air\neducational_poster4 | side,left | side of, wall_left | air\neducational_poster5 | side,left | side of, wall_left | air\neducational_poster6 | side,left | side of, wall_left | air\nwaste_bin1 | middle | ground | near, teacher_desk | side of, teacher_desk\nwaste_bin2 | edge | ground | near, wall_back | near, wall_left\nwaste_bin3 | edge | ground | near, wall_back | near, wall_right\npotted_plant1 | edge | ground | near, wall_front | near, wall_left\npotted_plant2 | edge | ground | near, wall_back | near, wall_right\nceiling_light1 | middle | top\nceiling_light2 | middle | top\nceiling_light3 | middle | top\nceiling_light4 | middle | top', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_FGFWZAdQu20WMq5R9FimZKOo'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_rQRUkjNZTlp6vX8tfN04i2pX', 'function': {'name': 'object_placement_module', 'arguments': '{"action_plan": "Overall Plan for Classroom Scene:\\n\\n1.

Write multiple long sentences, that will be forwarded to an \'3D Object Generator\'. The\n3D Object Generator will receive the specification field and creates a 3D Asset with your specification. Be as detailed as possible\nfor the specification. Use the styles as described in the action plan!\n- Create the same specification for the same types of items. For example: all student chairs are the same.\n- Dont write any coordinates or relations into the specification, only a visual description of the object should be in the specification!\n- Only use the valid json schema, see Examples.
