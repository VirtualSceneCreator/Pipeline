The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

[2025-05-21 23:57:36,011] INFO: Input:  1. Construct the classroom shell:
   • Create a rectangular floor plane sized to accommodate 15–20 people comfortably with walking space (approx. 10m × 8m).
   • Build four walls around the floor, each 3m high, leaving no ceiling.
2. Arrange student desks and chairs:
   • Generate 15 student desks (rectangular, 1.2m × 0.6m × 0.75m) in 3 rows of 5.
   • Place each desk on the floor with ~1m spacing front-to-back and side-to-side.
   • Add one complementary-colored chair (0.5m × 0.5m × 0.9m) per desk, aligned so chairs face front wall.
3. Add teacher’s area at front wall center:
   • Create a large teacher’s desk (2m × 0.8m × 0.75m) on the floor, centered along the front wall.
   • Place a teacher chair (0.6m × 0.6m × 1m) behind the teacher’s desk, facing the student desks.
4. Install front-wall fixtures:
   • Mount a large rectangular whiteboard (3m × 1.5m × 0.05m) on the front wall, positioned 1m above the floor and centered above the teacher’s desk.
   • Suspend a projector (0.4m × 0.4m × 0.2m) from the ceiling center, aligned with the whiteboard.
5. Place storage and décor:
   • Add two tall bookshelves (1m × 0.3m × 2m) filled with books, spaced evenly along the right-side wall.
   • Mount a large circular wall clock (0.5m diameter) on the back wall, at 2m height from the floor and centered.
   • Create two potted plants (0.5m × 0.5m × 1m): one near the entrance corner, one in a back corner.
   • Distribute multiple ceiling lights (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.1m each) in a 3×3 grid overhead for even illumination.
   • Attach educational posters/charts (0.6m × 0.8m each) on the side walls, evenly spaced between bookshelves and window.
   • Place two waste bins (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.5m): one adjacent to teacher’s desk, one next to exit door.
   • Create a large window (2m × 1.5m × 0.05m) with curtains (2m × 2m) on left-side wall to allow natural light.
6. Apply materials and colors:
   • Student desks: light wood tone finish; chairs: complementary fabric colors (e.g., pastel blues/greens).
   • Teacher’s desk: darker wood tone; teacher’s chair: matching darker upholstery.
   • Walls and floor: paint in light, bright colors (e.g., off-white walls, light grey floor) for an inviting atmosphere.
7. Ensure spatial relationship:
   • All chairs face the front wall and teacher’s desk.
   • Maintain minimum 0.6m walking clearance between chairs and desks and 1m between rows/desks.
   • Confirm no collisions between any objects.

We anchor on the teacher’s desk (2 m × 0.8 m × 0.75 m) since it defines the front area footprint. Student desks (1.2 m × 0.6 m × 0.75 m) in 3×5 with 1 m spacing yield exactly 10 m width (5×1.2 + 4×1) and 3.8 m depth (3×0.6 + 2×1). Chairs (0.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.9 m) slot under desks, needing 0.6 m clearance. A 1 m aisle between the teacher’s desk and first row, plus ~1 m behind the last row for circulation, arrives at ~8 m total depth. Floor width is set at 10 m to accommodate 5 desks and spacing. Walls are 3 m high with 0.1 m thickness enclosing this 10 m × 8 m area. Other fixtures like the whiteboard (3 m × 1.5 m × 0.05 m), window (2 m × 1.5 m × 0.05 m), bookshelves (1 m × 0.3 m × 2 m), and wall-mounted items (0.02–0.05 m depth) fit within these dimensions. Ceiling lights (0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.1 m) in a 3×3 grid ensure even lighting.

[2025-05-21 23:59:09,677] INFO: Input Action_plan:  1. Construct the classroom shell:
   • Create a rectangular floor plane sized to accommodate 15–20 people comfortably with walking space (approx. 10m × 8m).
   • Build four walls around the floor, each 3m high, leaving no ceiling.
2. Arrange student desks and chairs:
   • Generate 15 student desks (rectangular, 1.2m × 0.6m × 0.75m) in 3 rows of 5.
   • Place each desk on the floor with ~1m spacing front-to-back and side-to-side.
   • Add one complementary-colored chair (0.5m × 0.5m × 0.9m) per desk, aligned so chairs face front wall.
3. Add teacher’s area at front wall center:
   • Create a large teacher’s desk (2m × 0.8m × 0.75m) on the floor, centered along the front wall.
   • Place a teacher chair (0.6m × 0.6m × 1m) behind the teacher’s desk, facing the student desks.
4. Install front-wall fixtures:
   • Mount a large rectangular whiteboard (3m × 1.5m × 0.05m) on the front wall, positioned 1m above the floor and centered above the teacher’s desk.
   • Suspend a projector (0.4m × 0.4m × 0.2m) from the ceiling center, aligned with the whiteboard.
5. Place storage and décor:
   • Add two tall bookshelves (1m × 0.3m × 2m) filled with books, spaced evenly along the right-side wall.
   • Mount a large circular wall clock (0.5m diameter) on the back wall, at 2m height from the floor and centered.
   • Create two potted plants (0.5m × 0.5m × 1m): one near the entrance corner, one in a back corner.
   • Distribute multiple ceiling lights (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.1m each) in a 3×3 grid overhead for even illumination.
   • Attach educational posters/charts (0.6m × 0.8m each) on the side walls, evenly spaced between bookshelves and window.
   • Place two waste bins (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.5m): one adjacent to teacher’s desk, one next to exit door.
   • Create a large window (2m × 1.5m × 0.05m) with curtains (2m × 2m) on left-side wall to allow natural light.
6. Apply materials and colors:
   • Student desks: light wood tone finish; chairs: complementary fabric colors (e.g., pastel blues/greens).
   • Teacher’s desk: darker wood tone; teacher’s chair: matching darker upholstery.
   • Walls and floor: paint in light, bright colors (e.g., off-white walls, light grey floor) for an inviting atmosphere.
7. Ensure spatial relationship:
   • All chairs face the front wall and teacher’s desk.
   • Maintain minimum 0.6m walking clearance between chairs and desks and 1m between rows/desks.
   • Confirm no collisions between any objects.

Next I lay out 15 student desks in three rows of five, spacing each about a meter apart, and add matching chairs facing the front. The teacher’s desk and chair occupy the front center, flanked by the whiteboard above and a suspended projector. Along the right wall are two bookshelves; the left wall hosts a window with curtains and two posters. On the back wall is a clock, and another pair of posters flank the room side walls. Waste bins sit by the teacher’s area and exit, while potted plants occupy opposite corners. Nine ceiling lights form a 3×3 grid overhead. All clearances and orientations ensure easy movement and no collisions.

[2025-05-22 00:02:23,952] INFO: Input Action Plan:  1. Construct the classroom shell:
   • Create a rectangular floor plane sized to accommodate 15–20 people comfortably with walking space (approx. 10m × 8m).
   • Build four walls around the floor, each 3m high, leaving no ceiling.
2. Arrange student desks and chairs:
   • Generate 15 student desks (rectangular, 1.2m × 0.6m × 0.75m) in 3 rows of 5.
   • Place each desk on the floor with ~1m spacing front-to-back and side-to-side.
   • Add one complementary-colored chair (0.5m × 0.5m × 0.9m) per desk, aligned so chairs face front wall.
3. Add teacher’s area at front wall center:
   • Create a large teacher’s desk (2m × 0.8m × 0.75m) on the floor, centered along the front wall.
   • Place a teacher chair (0.6m × 0.6m × 1m) behind the teacher’s desk, facing the student desks.
4. Install front-wall fixtures:
   • Mount a large rectangular whiteboard (3m × 1.5m × 0.05m) on the front wall, positioned 1m above the floor and centered above the teacher’s desk.
   • Suspend a projector (0.4m × 0.4m × 0.2m) from the ceiling center, aligned with the whiteboard.
5. Place storage and décor:
   • Add two tall bookshelves (1m × 0.3m × 2m) filled with books, spaced evenly along the right-side wall.
   • Mount a large circular wall clock (0.5m diameter) on the back wall, at 2m height from the floor and centered.
   • Create two potted plants (0.5m × 0.5m × 1m): one near the entrance corner, one in a back corner.
   • Distribute multiple ceiling lights (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.1m each) in a 3×3 grid overhead for even illumination.
   • Attach educational posters/charts (0.6m × 0.8m each) on the side walls, evenly spaced between bookshelves and window.
   • Place two waste bins (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.5m): one adjacent to teacher’s desk, one next to exit door.
   • Create a large window (2m × 1.5m × 0.05m) with curtains (2m × 2m) on left-side wall to allow natural light.
6. Apply materials and colors:
   • Student desks: light wood tone finish; chairs: complementary fabric colors (e.g., pastel blues/greens).
   • Teacher’s desk: darker wood tone; teacher’s chair: matching darker upholstery.
   • Walls and floor: paint in light, bright colors (e.g., off-white walls, light grey floor) for an inviting atmosphere.
7. Ensure spatial relationship:
   • All chairs face the front wall and teacher’s desk.
   • Maintain minimum 0.6m walking clearance between chairs and desks and 1m between rows/desks.
   • Confirm no collisions between any objects.

Construct the classroom shell:\n   • Create a rectangular floor plane sized to accommodate 15–20 people comfortably with walking space (approx. 10m × 8m).\n   • Build four walls around the floor, each 3m high, leaving no ceiling.\n2. Arrange student desks and chairs:\n   • Generate 15 student desks (rectangular, 1.2m × 0.6m × 0.75m) in 3 rows of 5.\n   • Place each desk on the floor with ~1m spacing front-to-back and side-to-side.\n   • Add one complementary-colored chair (0.5m × 0.5m × 0.9m) per desk, aligned so chairs face front wall.\n3. Add teacher’s area at front wall center:\n   • Create a large teacher’s desk (2m × 0.8m × 0.75m) on the floor, centered along the front wall.\n   • Place a teacher chair (0.6m × 0.6m × 1m) behind the teacher’s desk, facing the student desks.\n4. Install front-wall fixtures:\n   • Mount a large rectangular whiteboard (3m × 1.5m × 0.05m) on the front wall, positioned 1m above the floor and centered above the teacher’s desk.\n   • Suspend a projector (0.4m × 0.4m × 0.2m) from the ceiling center, aligned with the whiteboard.\n5. Place storage and décor:\n   • Add two tall bookshelves (1m × 0.3m × 2m) filled with books, spaced evenly along the right-side wall.\n   • Mount a large circular wall clock (0.5m diameter) on the back wall, at 2m height from the floor and centered.\n   • Create two potted plants (0.5m × 0.5m × 1m): one near the entrance corner, one in a back corner.\n   • Distribute multiple ceiling lights (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.1m each) in a 3×3 grid overhead for even illumination.\n   • Attach educational posters/charts (0.6m × 0.8m each) on the side walls, evenly spaced between bookshelves and window.\n   • Place two waste bins (0.3m × 0.3m × 0.5m): one adjacent to teacher’s desk, one next to exit door.\n   • Create a large window (2m × 1.5m × 0.05m) with curtains (2m × 2m) on left-side wall to allow natural light.\n6. Apply materials and colors:\n   • Student desks: light wood tone finish; chairs: complementary fabric colors (e.g., pastel blues/greens).\n   • Teacher’s desk: darker wood tone; teacher’s chair: matching darker upholstery.\n   • Walls and floor: paint in light, bright colors (e.g., off-white walls, light grey floor) for an inviting atmosphere.\n7. Ensure spatial relationship:\n   • All chairs face the front wall and teacher’s desk.\n   • Maintain minimum 0.6m walking clearance between chairs and desks and 1m between rows/desks.\n   • Confirm no collisions between any objects.\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor_plane | middle\', \'wall_front | edge | on top of, floor_plane | ground | top\', \'wall_back | edge | on

Next I lay out 15 student desks in three rows of five, spacing each about a meter apart, and add matching chairs facing the front. The teacher’s desk and chair occupy the front center, flanked by the whiteboard above and a suspended projector. Along the right wall are two bookshelves; the left wall hosts a window with curtains and two posters. On the back wall is a clock, and another pair of posters flank the room side walls. Waste bins sit by the teacher’s area and exit, while potted plants occupy opposite corners. Nine ceiling lights form a 3×3 grid overhead. All clearances and orientations ensure easy movement and no collisions.\n\nfloor_plane | middle\n\nwall_front | edge | on top of, floor_plane | ground | top\nwall_back | edge | on top of, floor_plane | ground | top\nwall_left | edge | on top of, floor_plane | ground | top\nwall_right | edge | on top of, floor_plane | ground | top\n\ndesk1 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_front\ndesk2 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk1\ndesk3 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk2\ndesk4 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk3\ndesk5 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk4\ndesk6 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk1\ndesk7 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk6\ndesk8 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk7\ndesk9 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk8\ndesk10 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk9\ndesk11 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk6\ndesk12 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk11\ndesk13 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk12\ndesk14 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk13\ndesk15 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk14\n\nchair1 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk1 | face to, desk1\nchair2 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk2 | face to, desk2\nchair3 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk3 | face to, desk3\nchair4 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk4 | face to, desk4\nchair5 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk5 | face to, desk5\nchair6 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk6 | face to, desk6\nchair7 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk7 | face to, desk7\nchair8 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk8 | face to, desk8\nchair9 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk9 | face to, desk9\nchair10 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk10 | face to, desk10\nchair11 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk11 | face to, desk11\nchair12 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk12 | face to, desk12\nchair13 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk13 | face to, desk13\nchair14 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk14 | face to, desk14\nchair15 | middle | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, desk15 | face to, desk15\n\nteacher_desk | front | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_front | center aligned, wall_front\nteacher_chair | front | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, teacher_desk | face to, teacher_desk\n\nwhiteboard | edge | on top of, wall_front | air | center aligned, teacher_desk\nprojector | middle | flying top air | center aligned, whiteboard\n\nbookshelf1 | side, right | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_right\nbookshelf2 | side, right | on top of, floor_plane | ground | far, bookshelf1 | near, wall_right\n\nwindow | side, left | on top of, wall_left | ground\ncurtains | side, left | on top of, window | ground\n\nposter1 | side, left | on top of, wall_left | air | near, window\nposter2 | side, left | on top of, wall_left | air | far, poster1\nposter3 | side, right | on top of, wall_right | air | near, bookshelf1\nposter4 | side, right | on top of, wall_right | air | far, poster3\n\nwall_clock | edge | on top of, wall_back | air | center aligned, wall_back\n\nwaste_bin1 | front | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, teacher_desk\nwaste_bin2 | back | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_back\n\nplant1 | front | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_left | near, wall_front\nplant2 | back | on top of, floor_plane | ground | near, wall_right | near, wall_back\n\nceiling_light1 | middle | flying top air\nceiling_light2 | middle | flying top air | side of, ceiling_light1\nceiling_light3 | middle | flying top air | side of, ceiling_light2\nceiling_light4 | middle | flying top air | in front of, ceiling_light1\nceiling_light5 | middle | flying top air | in front of, ceiling_light2\nceiling_light6 | middle | flying top air | in front of, ceiling_light3\nceiling_light7 | middle | flying top air | side of, ceiling_light4\nceiling_light8 | middle | flying top air | side of, ceiling_light7\nceiling_light9 | middle | flying top air | side of, ceiling_light8', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_RxvTrwlt3YHf6Da14r1UhMHC'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_dKOKZfW7Cuq2RmdKPfUaegUG', 'function': {'name': 'object_placement_module', 'arguments': '{"action_plan": "1.

All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with spacing for comfortable movement.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the classroom, centered and with a chair facing the student desks.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a projector suspended from the ceiling aligned with the whiteboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along one side wall.\n- Position a large circular wall clock on the back wall, clearly visible to all students.\n- Include two potted plants, one near the entrance and one in a corner to add greenery.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly throughout the classroom.\n- Put educational posters and charts on side walls, spaced evenly.\n- Add two waste bins, one near the teacher\'s desk and one near the exit door.\n- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to bring in natural light.\n- Construct four walls and a floor for the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Color the student desks in light wood tones, teacher desk in darker wood tones, chairs in complementary colors.\n- Paint walls and floor in light, bright colors to create an inviting learning atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and teacher desk.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects, avoiding any collisions.\n-
