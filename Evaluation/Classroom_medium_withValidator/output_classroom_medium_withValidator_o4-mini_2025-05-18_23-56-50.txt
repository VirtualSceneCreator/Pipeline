The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

[2025-05-18 23:40:29,572] INFO: Result:  My design leverages a hierarchical anchor approach: I first set the floor and ceiling as parents for all floor- and ceiling-based items. Next I place the four walls by global orientation (north as front, south as back, east as side,right, west as side,left). I then mount large fixtures on each wall: a tall bookshelf on the west wall, the blackboard and wall clock flanked by posters on the north wall, and two dinosaur posters on the south wall. The teacher area is centered at the front with desk, chair and a trash bin. Overhead lighting is anchored to the ceiling center. Along the east wall corner I build the dinosaur exhibit with three models, two potted plants and two posters above them. Finally I lay out student desks in two rows with chairs facing north, ensuring 1 m walkways and side aisles. Each object only references previously placed anchors.

Next I place the four walls by global orientation (north as front, south as back, east as side,right, west as side,left). I then mount large fixtures on each wall: a tall bookshelf on the west wall, the blackboard and wall clock flanked by posters on the north wall, and two dinosaur posters on the south wall. The teacher area is centered at the front with desk, chair and a trash bin. Overhead lighting is anchored to the ceiling center. Along the east wall corner I build the dinosaur exhibit with three models, two potted plants and two posters above them. Finally I lay out student desks in two rows with chairs facing north, ensuring 1 m walkways and side aisles.

[2025-05-18 23:46:29,252] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom room size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher's desk and board.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.
- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.
- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.
- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.
- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.
- Add trash bins near the teacher's desk and at the rear of the classroom.
- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.
- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.
- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.
- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.
- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher\'s desk and board.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.\n- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.\n- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.\n- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.\n- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.\n- Add trash bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the rear of the classroom.\n- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.\n- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.\n- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.\n- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-18 23:50:07,649] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom room size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher's desk and board.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.
- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.
- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.
- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.
- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.
- Add trash bins near the teacher's desk and at the rear of the classroom.
- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.
- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.
- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.
- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.
- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher\'s desk and board.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.\n- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.\n- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.\n- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.\n- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.\n- Add trash bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the rear of the classroom.\n- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.\n- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.\n- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.\n- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'All student chairs (student_chair1…student_chair10)\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[student_chair1..student_chair10]\', \'issue\': \'Chairs are placed only ~0.1 units behind desks, causing collision and no legroom.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move all student chairs back along the z-axis by +0.4 units (e.g. student_chairX.position.z += 0.4) so there is ~0.5 units of clearance between each desk front and chair back.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'teacher_chair\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[teacher_chair]\', \'issue\': \'Chair is rotated 180° and faces away from the students.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set teacher_chair.rotation.y to 0° so it faces toward the students (positive Z direction).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'All dinosaur models (dinosaur_model1, dinosaur_model2, dinosaur_model3)\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[dinosaur_model1, dinosaur_model2, dinosaur_model3]\', \'issue\': \'Models are too close to the right wall and collide with the wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reduce their x position from 5.55 to 5.3 (e.g. dinosaur_modelX.position.x = 5.3) to clear the 0.2-unit wall thickness.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant1\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[potted_plant1]\', \'issue\': \'Collides with dinosaur models (overlapping in x/z).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move potted_plant1 to a back corner behind the exhibit, e.g. set position to {x: 4.5, y: 0.6, z: 2.0}.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant2\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[potted_plant2]\', \'issue\': \'Collides with dinosaur models (overlapping in x/z).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move potted_plant2 behind the exhibit area, e.g. set position to {x: 5.3, y: 0.6, z: 2.5}.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'trash_bin1\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[trash_bin1]\', \'issue\': "Bin is only ~0.2 units from the teacher\'s desk edge, causing collision.", \'suggestedFix\': \'Shift it further right: set position to {x: 1.8, y: 0.3, z: -3.25} to achieve ~0.7 units clearance.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'tall_bookshelf\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[tall_bookshelf]\', \'issue\': \'Bookshelf overlaps the left wall thickness (colliding with wall_short_2).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Pull it inward: set position.x to -4.9 (was -5.7) so its back face sits flush against the interior wall face.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'overhead_light\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[overhead_light]\', \'issue\': \'Light fixture intersects the ceiling slab by ~0.05 units.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Lower the fixture slightly: set position.y to 3.3 so its top sits just below the ceiling plane.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_clock\', \'path\': \'scene.objects[wall_clock]\', \'issue\': \'Clock overlaps the front wall thickness by ~0.03 units.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Push it flush: set position.z to -3.9 (from -3.875) so it sits cleanly on the interior wall surface.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-18 23:51:45,900] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom room size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher's desk and board.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.
- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.
- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.
- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.
- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.
- Add trash bins near the teacher's desk and at the rear of the classroom.
- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.
- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.
- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.
- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.
- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

room size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher\'s desk and board.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.\n- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.\n- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.\n- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.\n- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.\n- Add trash bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the rear of the classroom.\n- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.\n- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.\n- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.\n- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

room size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher\'s desk and board.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.\n- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.\n- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.\n- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.\n- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.\n- Add trash bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the rear of the classroom.\n- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.\n- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.\n- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.\n- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher's desk and board.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.
- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.
- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.
- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.
- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.
- Add trash bins near the teacher's desk and at the rear of the classroom.
- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.
- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.
- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.
- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.
- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Align all student chairs to face forward towards the teacher\'s desk and board.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, with a chair facing the students, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur exhibit corner in one side of the classroom with 3 medium-sized dinosaur models made from 3D shapes, positioned on the floor with enough space between for walking.\n- Place dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur books and fossils replicas along a side wall.\n- Include a natural-looking potted plant or two near the dinosaur exhibit.\n- Create a large overhead light fixture centered on the ceiling to illuminate the classroom brightly.\n- Install a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the blackboard.\n- Add trash bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the rear of the classroom.\n- Color desks and chairs in natural wood tones with green accents to complement the dinosaur theme.\n- Use earth tones and leafy green shades for walls and floor to match the dinosaur subject atmosphere.\n- Create a ceiling for the classroom with the lighting fixture attached.\n- Create a floor, and 4 walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Ensure ample walking space between all desks, chairs, teacher desk, dinosaur models, and bookshelf with no collisions.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'floor\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/floor\', \'issue\': \'Floor collider intersects with base of walls by 0.1m.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move floor to position y = -0.05 so its top (y = 0.0) aligns with wall bases and eliminates collision.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student chairs\', \'path\': \'scene/objects\', \'issue\': \'Student chairs are offset too far forward, overlapping the aisle and not aligned with their desks.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'For student_chair1 through student_chair5 (front row), set z = -0.95 (keep x and y unchanged).
