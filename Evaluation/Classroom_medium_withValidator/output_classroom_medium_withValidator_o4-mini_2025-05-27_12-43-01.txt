The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

The teacher’s desk and chair go near the back wall facing north, with a whiteboard mounted above and a projector suspended overhead. Student desks form two rows facing the board, each chair tucked behind its desk with cushions on top. Dinosaur models act as floor accents. Skeleton display cases and posters alternate along east and west walls, with a bookshelf and clock also on those walls. Corner potted plants anchor the back corners. Ceiling lights form a symmetrical grid near the ceiling, and wall trims run low along every wall. Constraints ensure proper alignment, heights, distances, and orientations throughout.

[2025-05-27 12:29:12,302] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size comfortably fitting 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.
- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.
- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.
- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.
- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.
- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.
- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.
- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.
- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.
- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher's desk and front board.
- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.

student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.\n- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.\n- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.\n- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.\n- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.\n- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.\n- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.\n- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.\n- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher\'s desk and front board.\n- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_north\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_north\', \'issue\': \'Wall pivot is placed at the floor boundary (z = -5.625), causing its 0.2-unit thickness to intrude 0.1 units into the room interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move along negative Z by 0.1 units: set position.z = -5.725\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_south\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_south\', \'issue\': \'Wall pivot is placed at the floor boundary (z = 5.625), causing its 0.2-unit thickness to intrude 0.1 units into the room interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move along positive Z by 0.1 units: set position.z = 5.725\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_east\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_east\', \'issue\': \'Wall pivot is placed at the floor boundary (x = 5.1), causing its 0.2-unit thickness to intrude 0.1 units into the room interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move along positive X by 0.1 units: set position.x = 5.2\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_west\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_west\', \'issue\': \'Wall pivot is placed at the floor boundary (x = -5.1), causing its 0.2-unit thickness to intrude 0.1 units into the room interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move along negative X by 0.1 units: set position.x = -5.2\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Student Desks, Chairs, and Cushions\', \'path\': \'Museum_Exhibit_Room/objects\', \'issue\': \'Walkway at room sides is too narrow (only ~0.2m between desk edges and walls), leading to cramped aisles.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition student desks to X positions [-4.0, -2.0, 0.0, 2.0, 4.0] for both rows and match all student chairs and cushions to these X positions (Z positions unchanged) to increase side aisles to ~0.6m.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Cushions (cushion1–cushion10)\', \'path\': \'Museum_Exhibit_Room/objects\', \'issue\': \'Cushions share the same Y position as chairs, causing visual overlap and collision.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set the Y position of all cushions to 0.55 (cushion thickness half above chair seat) so they rest properly on the chair surfaces.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Skeleton Display Cases\', \'path\': \'Museum_Exhibit_Room/objects\', \'issue\': \'Display cases centered at X=±5.1 extend ~0.25m outside the room boundaries.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'For skeleton_case1–skeleton_case4 (east wall), set X to 4.85;

[2025-05-27 12:37:54,593] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size comfortably fitting 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.
- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.
- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.
- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.
- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.
- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.
- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.
- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.
- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.
- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher's desk and front board.
- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.

with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.\n- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.\n- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.\n- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.\n- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.\n- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.\n- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.\n- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.\n- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher\'s desk and front board.\n- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:38:51,923] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size comfortably fitting 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.
- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.
- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.
- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.
- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.
- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.
- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.
- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.
- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.
- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher's desk and front board.
- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.

with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.\n- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.\n- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.\n- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.\n- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.\n- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.\n- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.\n- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.\n- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher\'s desk and front board.\n- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:41:06,505] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size comfortably fitting 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.
- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.
- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.
- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.
- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.
- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.
- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.
- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.
- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.
- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher's desk and front board.
- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.

space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Design student chairs to face forward towards the front classroom area.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard for presentations.\n- Decorate the classroom with 3 large realistic dinosaur models placed around the room on the floor, spaced evenly and safely.\n- Add 5 dinosaur skeleton display cases (elongated rectangular prisms with transparent surfaces) placed along the side walls.\n- Install 2 large educational dinosaur posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur and paleontology books along one wall.\n- Place 1 large wall clock on a visible side wall for timekeeping.\n- Include 2 potted plants in dinosaur-themed pots in the corners for decoration.\n- Add adequate ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Create a floor and four walls for the classroom in neutral colors but with dinosaur motifs painted or decorated along the lower parts of the walls.\n- Use dinosaur-patterned cushions on the chairs for a thematic touch.\n- Ensure all chairs and desks are aligned and face towards the teacher\'s desk and front board.\n- Maintain sufficient walking space between all objects, desks, and chairs with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'teacher_chair\', \'path\': \'objects/teacher_chair\', \'issue\': \'Teacher chair overlaps with teacher desk interior\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to { x: 0.0, y: 0.5, z: -5.7 } so it sits directly behind the desk without collision\'}, {\'objectName\': \'projector\', \'path\': \'objects/projector\', \'issue\': \'Projector intersects the whiteboard surface on the front wall\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition to { x: 0.0, y: 2.9, z: -3.0 } (ceiling-mounted over the center aisle) to clear the whiteboard area\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_model1\', \'path\': \'objects/dinosaur_model1\', \'issue\': \'Model sits in the central aisle, blocking traffic and impinging on desk space\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to back-left corner at { x: -3.0, y: 0.75, z: 4.0 } to clear all aisles\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_model2\', \'path\': \'objects/dinosaur_model2\', \'issue\': \'Model is positioned in the middle of the floor plan, intersecting the main student aisle\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to back-center at { x: 0.0, y: 0.75, z: 4.0 } behind the last row of desks\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_model3\', \'path\': \'objects/dinosaur_model3\', \'issue\': \'Model occupies the aisle space and may collide with student seating\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to back-right corner at { x: 3.0, y: 0.75, z: 4.0 } for safe peripheral placement\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}
