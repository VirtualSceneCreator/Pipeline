The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

[2025-05-19 23:28:18,056] INFO: Result:  In this design, I start by placing the floor at the room’s center as the anchor and then define the four perimeter walls around it at their corresponding edges. Next, the teacher’s desk is fixed centrally on the front wall facing the student area; the blackboard is mounted just above it on the same wall, and a dinosaur projector hangs from the ceiling aligned with the blackboard. Ten student desks are arranged in two rows directly in front of the teacher’s desk—row 1 near (50–150 cm) and row 2 farther back (≥150 cm)—all facing the teacher’s desk with side-of chains to ensure even aisles. Three pedestals occupy the two front corners and the back-right corner, each topped with a skeleton model. Three fossil replicas adorn the left, right, and back walls. A bookshelf lines the left wall; a wall clock and a window with curtains go on the right wall. A potted plant sits in the back-left corner. Six ceiling lights are distributed in front and back rows on the ceiling. Four dinosaur posters decorate two spots on the left wall and two on the back wall. Waste bins stand by the teacher’s desk and back wall. Objects of the same category are aligned or chained to maintain consistent spacing and orientation.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

[2025-05-19 23:37:46,403] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.
- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.
- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.
- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.
- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.
- Create four walls for the classroom.

the action plan:\n- Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.\n- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.\n- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_projector\', \'path\': \'/scene/objects/dinosaur_projector\', \'issue\': \'Intersects the ceiling (Position.y = 3.25, model half-height = 0.1, top reaches y=3.35 above room height 3.2).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Lower to Position.y = 3.05 so the projector sits just below the ceiling (bottom at y=2.95, top at y=3.15).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window_with_curtains\', \'path\': \'/scene/objects/window_with_curtains\', \'issue\': \'Extends outside the right wall boundary (center x=4.95 with half-width 0.7 extends to x=5.65 beyond room limit +5.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition to Position.x = 4.2 (keep y=1.5, z=-1.0) so its extents [3.5,4.9] fit within the wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Student Desks\', \'path\': \'/scene/objects\', \'issue\': \'Missing chair GameObjects for the 10 student desks (action plan called for chairs facing the front).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Add a chair prefab behind each student desk: for each desk at (x, z), place a chair at (x, y=0.375, z=desk.z + desk.depth/2 + chair.depth/2 + 0.1), set Rotation.y = 180 so chairs face the blackboard.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'skeleton_model1, skeleton_model2, skeleton_model3\', \'path\': \'/scene/objects\', \'issue\': \'Skeleton models sit exactly flush on top of pedestals (bottom y=0.6 equals pedestal top y=0.6), risking z-fighting or visual clipping.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Raise each skeleton by +0.01 in Y (new Position.y = 1.36) so they sit just above pedestal tops.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'fossil_replica1, fossil_replica2, fossil_replica3\', \'path\': \'/scene/objects\', \'issue\': \'Fossil replicas slightly clip into walls due to model depth overlapping wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Push replicas flush to wall faces: set fossil_replica1 Position.x = -4.875, fossil_replica2 Position.x = 4.875, and fossil_replica3 Position.z = 5.875.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-19 23:42:44,925] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.
- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.
- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.
- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.
- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.
- Create four walls for the classroom.

desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.\n- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.\n- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-19 23:44:04,279] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.
- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.
- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.
- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.
- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.
- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.

desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.\n- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.\n- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'waste_bin_teacher\', \'path\': \'Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit/waste_bin_teacher\', \'issue\': \'Collides with teacher_desk (overlapping in Z-axis)\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Keep X at -1.2 and Y at 0.3; set Z to -4.8 to clear overlap with teacher_desk\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf\', \'path\': \'Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit/bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'Positioned too far into the room (not flush with left wall)\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set X to -4.7 (from -4.3) to align the back of the bookshelf with the interior face of the left wall\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window_with_curtains\', \'path\': \'Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit/window_with_curtains\', \'issue\': \'Placed too far into the room (not flush with right wall)\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set X to 4.85 (from 4.2) to align the window flush with the interior face of the right wall\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_clock\', \'path\': \'Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit/wall_clock\', \'issue\': \'Minor offset from wall (should be flush)\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set X to 4.85 (from 4.88) to align the clock flush on the right wall\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_projector\', \'path\': \'Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit/dinosaur_projector\', \'issue\': \'Not centered above and oriented toward the blackboard; slightly recessed from ceiling\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Y to 3.1 (flush to ceiling), Z to -5.875 (center over blackboard), and Rotation X to 90° (tilt downward toward the board)\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear spacing in between.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models arranged around the room on the floor and on a few display pedestals.\n- Place dinosaur fossil replicas attached to the side and back walls as decoration.\n- Create a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur reference books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock with a dinosaur motif on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room to add some natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and other objects with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a natural wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, and chairs in complementary earthy tones.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and floor to make the room bright while highlighting dinosaur decorations.\n- Create a floor with the right size so that all objects fit comfortably in the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]\nPut this scene into the json format: ```json\n{\n  "scene": {\n    "sceneName": "Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_Exhibit",\n
