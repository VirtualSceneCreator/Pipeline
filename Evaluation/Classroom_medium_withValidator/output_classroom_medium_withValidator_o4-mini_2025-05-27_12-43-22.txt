The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

We anchor our classroom on a standard student desk sized 1.2 m (W) × 0.75 m (H) × 0.6 m (D). Chairs are proportioned at 0.5 m × 0.9 m × 0.5 m. Horizontal spacing between desks is 0.5 m, with 1.2 m between rows. We allow a 1 m margin behind the back row and a 1 m margin in front of the teacher’s desk, plus a 0.8 m deep teacher zone. Two rows of five desks plus margins result in a footprint of approximately 9 m width by 7 m depth. Walls stand 3 m tall with 0.1 m thickness, and the floor has 0.1 m thickness. All larger elements—teacher’s desk, board, display cases, skeleton, bookshelves, world map, posters, lights, and plants—are scaled relative to the desk anchor to maintain realistic proportions and adequate circulation space.

All larger elements—teacher’s desk, board, display cases, skeleton, bookshelves, world map, posters, lights, and plants—are scaled relative to the desk anchor to maintain realistic proportions and adequate circulation space.\n\n{"name":"student_desk1","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"teacher_desk","size":{"width":1.8,"height":0.75,"depth":0.8}}\n{"name":"dino_blackboard","size":{"width":4.0,"height":2.0,"depth":0.05}}\n{"name":"dino_skeleton","size":{"width":2.0,"height":1.5,"depth":1.0}}\n{"name":"bookshelf1","size":{"width":1.5,"height":1.8,"depth":0.3}}\n{"name":"bookshelf2","size":{"width":1.5,"height":1.8,"depth":0.3}}\n{"name":"bookshelf3","size":{"width":1.5,"height":1.8,"depth":0.3}}\n{"name":"display_case1","size":{"width":1.0,"height":1.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"display_case2","size":{"width":1.0,"height":1.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"world_map","size":{"width":2.0,"height":1.5,"depth":0.02}}\n{"name":"dino_poster1","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster2","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster3","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster4","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster5","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster6","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster7","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"dino_poster8","size":{"width":0.6,"height":0.8,"depth":0.01}}\n{"name":"student_desk2","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk3","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk4","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk5","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk6","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk7","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk8","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk9","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_desk10","size":{"width":1.2,"height":0.75,"depth":0.6}}\n{"name":"student_chair1","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair2","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair3","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair4","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair5","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair6","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair7","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair8","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair9","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"student_chair10","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.9,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light1","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light2","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light3","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light4","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light5","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"ceiling_light6","size":{"width":0.5,"height":0.2,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"potted_plant1","size":{"width":0.5,"height":1.0,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"potted_plant2","size":{"width":0.5,"height":1.0,"depth":0.5}}\n{"name":"wall_front","size":{"width":9.0,"height":3.0,"depth":0.1}}\n{"name":"wall_back","size":{"width":9.0,"height":3.0,"depth":0.1}}\n{"name":"wall_left","size":{"width":7.0,"height":3.0,"depth":0.1}}\n{"name":"wall_right","size":{"width":7.0,"height":3.0,"depth":0.1}}\n{"name":"floor","size":{"width":9.0,"height":0.1,"depth":7.0}}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_hAVdig6brIhTrVfQ9y9R1Iys'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'stream': False, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'game_objects_size_module', 'description': 'Returns a plan for the specific zones in the fair booth.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'action_plan': {'description': 'The action plan to create the zones', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['action_plan'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'relation_module', 'description': 'Returns a plan for the specific zones in the fair booth.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'objects': {'description': 'List of the objects, that will be placed in the unity scene', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'type': 'array'}, 'action_plan': {'description': 'The action plan with details of the relations', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objects', 'action_plan'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'object_placement_module', 'description': 'Returns the specific objects placed in the 3D World.

[2025-05-27 12:24:27,100] INFO: Result:  In this design, the classroom is a rectangular space sized to accommodate two rows of five student desks with sufficient aisles. The teacher's desk sits centered at the front, in front of a dinosaur-themed blackboard mounted on the front wall. Three bookshelves line the back wall, two fossil display cases stand along the left wall, a world map hangs on the right wall, and a dinosaur skeleton model is near the front-right corner. Student desks are grouped into a front row close to the teacher and a second row further back, each paired with a facing chair. Colorful dinosaur posters are spaced along the side walls. Ceiling lights hang evenly overhead, and potted plants occupy the front-left and back-right corners. All desks and chairs face the front blackboard, with natural earth tones for furniture and bright colors for thematic elements. The floor features a prehistoric rocky texture.

Chairs are proportioned at 0.5 m × 0.9 m × 0.5 m. Horizontal spacing between desks is 0.5 m, with 1.2 m between rows. We allow a 1 m margin behind the back row and a 1 m margin in front of the teacher’s desk, plus a 0.8 m deep teacher zone. Two rows of five desks plus margins result in a footprint of approximately 9 m width by 7 m depth. Walls stand 3 m tall with 0.1 m thickness, and the floor has 0.1 m thickness. All larger elements—teacher’s desk, board, display cases, skeleton, bookshelves, world map, posters, lights, and plants—are scaled relative to the desk anchor to maintain realistic proportions and

- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.
- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.
- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.
- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.
- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.
- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.
- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.
- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.
- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.
- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.
- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.
- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.

Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.\n- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.\n- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.\n- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.\n- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.\n- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.\n- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.\n- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.\n- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.\n- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.\n- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor | middle\', \'wall_front | front\', \'wall_back | back\', \'wall_left | side, left\', \'wall_right |

We allow a 1 m margin behind the back row and a 1 m margin in front of the teacher’s desk, plus a 0.8 m deep teacher zone. Two rows of five desks plus margins result in a footprint of approximately 9 m width by 7 m depth. Walls stand 3 m tall with 0.1 m thickness, and the floor has 0.1 m thickness.

Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students ensuring enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.\n- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.\n- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.\n- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.\n- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.\n- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.\n- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.\n- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.\n- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.\n- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.\n- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.
- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.
- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.
- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.
- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.
- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.
- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.
- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.
- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.
- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.
- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.

individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.\n- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.\n- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.\n- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.\n- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.\n- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.\n- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.\n- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.\n- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.\n- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.\n- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:32:40,238] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students ensuring enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.
- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.
- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.
- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.
- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.
- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.
- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.
- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.
- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.
- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.
- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.
- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.

[2025-05-27 12:35:20,392] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students ensuring enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.
- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.
- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.
- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.
- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.
- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.
- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.
- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.
- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.
- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.
- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.
- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.

If they are not okay, write a Fix Suggestions.\n\n**Automated Fix Suggestions**  \n- For every issue found, generate an **Issue Report** containing:  \n- **objectName** (name of the object)  \n- **path** Hierarchy path\n- **issue** Issue Description \n- **suggestedFix** Suggested Fix: new Position, Rotation and/or Scale (absolute values or relative adjustments).  \n- You are allowed to propose modifications to an object’s Position, Rotation, and Scale to correct the scene.\n\nHere are some guidelines for you:\n1. I will use your guideline to validate the objects *iteratively*, so please start with the first wall in your thought process.\n\nOnly Respond with the Automated Fix Suggestions, do NOT try to recreate

individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.\n- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.\n- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.\n- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.\n- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.\n- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.\n- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.\n- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.\n- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.\n- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.\n- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-27 12:38:48,861] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students ensuring enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.
- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.
- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.
- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.
- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.
- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.
- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.
- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.
- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.
- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.
- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.

the action plan:\n- Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students ensuring enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 individual student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between each desk.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create dinosaur fossil display cases as rectangular glass boxes on stands, place 2 cases along one side wall.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton model(s) positioned in a corner or near the front of the classroom.\n- Create colorful dinosaur posters depicting various dinosaur species evenly spaced on the walls.\n- Place dinosaur-themed bookshelves with books and models along the back wall.\n- Add a large world map on a side wall highlighting dinosaur fossil discovery locations.\n- Include ambient lighting in the classroom, with ceiling lights evenly spaced.\n- Create a floor covering that resembles a rocky or prehistoric ground texture.\n- Add potted plants in a corner or by the window to enhance the prehistoric theme.\n- Position teacher and student desks and chairs all facing forward towards the blackboard.\n- Ensure enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects without collisions.\n- Use earthy tones and natural colors for desks and chairs, and bright, warm colors for dinosaur decorations.\n- Create four walls and a floor sized appropriately to fit all objects.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_front\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_front\', \'issue\': \'Wall pivoted at z = -4.0
