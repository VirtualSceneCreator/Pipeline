The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

2. Create floor and four walls (no ceiling): floor plane of 10×8m, four vertical walls of 10m or 8m length and 3m height.
3. Student desks and chairs: define 10 desk objects (1.2×0.6×0.75m) and 10 matching chairs (0.5×0.5×0.9m), arrange in two rows of five with 1m center-to-center spacing and 0.8m aisles.
4. Teacher’s desk and chair: desk (1.8×0.8×0.75m) and chair (0.6×0.6×1.0m), centered at front wall, 1.5m from front wall.
5. Blackboard/whiteboard: rectangular board (4×1.5×0.05m) mounted on front wall above teacher’s desk, centered horizontally, bottom edge at 1.0m from floor.
6. Posters: dinosaur-themed posters (0.6×0.9×0.02m) – place 6 total: two on each side wall spaced evenly, two on back wall.
7. Dinosaur figurines: 3 models (~0.4×0.2×0.3m each) on wall-mounted shelves (1.0×0.3×0.1m) on side walls at 1.5m height.
8. Dinosaur skeleton replica: assembled from cubes (0.1m side) and cylinders (0.1m diameter), overall footprint ~1.5×1.5m, placed in back-left corner on floor.
9. Bookshelf: rectangular shelf unit (2×0.4×2m) against right side wall, stocked with books.
10. Lighting: ceiling-mounted lights (0.3×0.3×0.2m each), place 6 fixtures in two rows of three, evenly spaced on ceiling plane at height 2.8m.
11. Wall clock: circular clock (0.3m dia) on side wall at 2m height.
12. Potted plant: plant + pot (0.5×0.5×0.8m) in back-right corner on floor.
13. Waste bins: two bins (0.4×0.4×0.5m): one near teacher’s desk, one at back of room.
14. Materials and colors: student desks and chairs in earth tones; neutral light wall colors; floor texture subtle outdoor terrain pattern.
15. Ensure clear walkable spaces: at least 0.8m clearance around desks, chairs, dinosaur models, and exhibits with no collisions.
16. Object placement: floor-mounted, wall-mounted, or ceiling-mounted as appropriate.

Proceed to calculate and return sizes for each GameObject.

[2025-05-20 14:48:09,247] INFO: Result:  In this design, the classroom is organized with a clear front and back. We anchor the floor and walls to define the room boundaries. Student desks are arranged in two rows of five, evenly spaced across the width, with chairs placed behind each desk at an ergonomic distance and oriented to face the desk. The teacher’s desk and chair are centered near the front wall under the blackboard. The blackboard is mounted centrally on the front wall at a standard viewing height. Educational posters and dinosaur shelves are distributed on the side and back walls at eye level, with matching figurines displayed on top. A skeleton replica is positioned in the back-left corner as a feature display, balanced by a bookshelf and potted plant in the back-right. Ceiling lights form two rows above the desks to ensure uniform lighting. A wall clock, waste bins, and other accessories are placed for easy access and to maintain clear walking paths with at least 0.8 m clearance. Earth tones for furniture and neutral finishes for walls and floor create a warm yet focused environment.

- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

We anchor the floor and walls to define the room boundaries. Student desks are arranged in two rows of five, evenly spaced across the width, with chairs placed behind each desk at an ergonomic distance and oriented to face the desk. The teacher’s desk and chair are centered near the front wall under the blackboard. The blackboard is mounted centrally on the front wall at a standard viewing height. Educational posters and dinosaur shelves are distributed on the side and back walls at eye level, with matching figurines displayed on top. A skeleton replica is positioned in the back-left corner as a feature display, balanced by a bookshelf and potted plant in the back-right. Ceiling lights form two rows above the desks to ensure uniform lighting. A wall clock, waste bins, and other accessories are placed for easy access and to maintain clear walking paths with at least 0.8 m clearance.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

[2025-05-20 14:55:23,291] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate room size for a classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.
- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.
- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.
- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.
- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.
- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.

classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model':

classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model':

- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.
- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.
- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.

classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the

[2025-05-20 14:59:14,000] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate room size for a classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.
- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.
- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.
- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.
- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.
- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.

was the action plan:\n- Determine an appropriate room size for a classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters':

- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.
- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.
- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.
- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.
- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.

students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini',

[2025-05-20 15:02:49,063] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate room size for a classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.
- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.
- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.
- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.
- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.
- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.

was the action plan:\n- Determine an appropriate room size for a classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'frontWall\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/frontWall\', \'issue\': \'The front wall is centered at

classroom with seating for 10 students, including sufficient space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Arrange 10 student desks as rectangular tables with matching chairs in two rows of five desks each, all placed on the floor with clear spacing.\n- Position all student chairs facing the front wall for the lesson.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place multiple dinosaur-themed educational posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Incorporate dinosaur models or sculptures: create 3 dinosaur figurines made from appropriately sized 3D models positioned on shelves on the side walls.\n- Include a large dinosaur skeleton replica model made of connected cubes and cylinders, placed in one corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Install ceiling-mounted lighting evenly spaced across the classroom for even illumination.\n- Position a wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add a potted plant near the back corner of the room.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earth tones appropriate for natural themes.\n- Use neutral wall colors and a floor with a subtle pattern suggestive of outdoor terrain.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and dinosaur models, with no collisions.\n- Position all objects either on the floor or mounted on walls or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\nPut this
