The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

Rotation constraint: \n    5.1) face to, object: face to the center of another object.\n    5.2) rotated: little bit rotated, to look better\n6. Height constraint:\n    6.1) ground: on the ground\n    6.2) top: touching the ceiling\n    6.3) air: between the ceiling and the ground\n\nFor each object, you must have one global constraint and you can select various numbers of constraints and any\ncombinations of them and the output format must be: object | global constraint | constraint 1 | constraint 2 | ...\nFor example: sofa-0 | edge\ncoffee table-0 | middle | near, sofa-0 | in front of, sofa-0 | center aligned, sofa-0 | face to, sofa-0\ntv stand-0 | edge | far, coffee table-0 | in front of, coffee table-0 | center aligned, coffee table-0 | face to,\ncoffee table-0\nflying car-0 | middle| far, coffee table-0 | flying top air\n\nHere are some guidelines for you:\n1. I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5.

I position the key teaching elements (teacher desk and blackboard) centrally at the front, followed by the student desks arranged in two neat rows with chairs directly behind, all oriented toward the blackboard. Large display and storage items (bookshelf, dinosaur skeleton, window) are mounted on side or back walls, with decorative posters and clocks on the walls at eye level. Utility objects like waste bins and the plant are tucked beside walls, and ceiling lights are evenly distributed as flying fixtures near the ceiling.

[2025-05-19 23:32:05,116] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Design the classroom space to accommodate 10 students with enough space for desks, chairs, and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks. Position all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.
- Place all student chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room on the floor, facing the student desks.
- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create walls and floor for the classroom with light colors to give a bright atmosphere.
- Add educational dinosaur posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Design a tall bookshelf along one side wall filled with dinosaur-related books and models.
- Place a large dinosaur skeleton model or replica near the back corner of the classroom on the floor.
- Add two circular wall clocks on side walls.
- Include a potted plant in one corner for a natural touch.
- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for good lighting.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall for natural light.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Color student desks and chairs in natural wood tones with complementary color accents.
- Position all objects without collisions and with enough walking space between desks and other items.
- Ensure all furniture and decorations are placed on the floor or mounted as appropriate.
- Make sure all student chairs face the dinosaur-themed board.

the Unity scene by yourself, thats not your job!\nWrite your improvement Suggestions in the json field 'issueReports'.\nIf you have no improvement Suggestions, write that in the field 'noImprovementSuggestions'.\n    "}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Validate this existing scene:\ncontent=\'{\\n  "scene": {\\n    "sceneName": "Dinosaur_Themed_Classroom_10_Students",\\n

Position all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Place all student chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create walls and floor for the classroom with light colors to give a bright atmosphere.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Design a tall bookshelf along one side wall filled with dinosaur-related books and models.\n- Place a large dinosaur skeleton model or replica near the back corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add two circular wall clocks on side walls.\n- Include a potted plant in one corner for a natural touch.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for good lighting.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall for natural light.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color student desks and chairs in natural wood tones with complementary color accents.\n- Position all objects without collisions and with enough walking space between desks and other items.\n- Ensure all furniture and decorations are placed on the floor or mounted as appropriate.\n- Make sure all student chairs face the dinosaur-themed board.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_skeleton\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/dinosaur_skeleton\', \'issue\': \'The dinosaur skeleton (depth 1.0) is centered at z = 5.8 and its front half extends to z = 6.3, penetrating the back wall (front face at z ≈ 5.9).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust its position to x = 0.0, y = 1.25, z = 5.4 so that the skeleton’s front/back extents sit flush against the wall without intersecting.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student_desk6-10 & student_chair6-10\', \'path\': \'scene/objects\', \'issue\': \'The aisle between the first row (student_desk1–5) and the second row (student_desk6–10) is only ~0.25 m wide—too narrow for comfortable movement.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Shift all second-row desks (student_desk6–10) by +1.0 m on Z (from z = 0.0 to z = 1.0) and their corresponding chairs (student_chair6–10) by +1.0 m on Z (from z = 0.8 to z = 1.8).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'The bookshelf sits at x = –4.8 flush on the left wall and its 0.4 m depth leaves only ~0.1 m of side clearance to the nearest desk.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Relocate the bookshelf to the back wall: set position to x = –4.0, y = 1.0, z = 5.8, and rotation to (0, 180, 0), clearing the side aisle.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'plant_foliage\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/plant_pot/plant_foliage\', \'issue\': \'No explicit position provided for the foliage child—by default it sits at the pot’s pivot and may intersect the pot.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set its world position to x = –4.2, y = 0.9, z = –4.0 (pot height 0.5 + foliage half-height 0.4 above ground).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'waste_bin1\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/waste_bin1\', \'issue\': \'The front waste bin at x = –1.0, z = –3.8 overlaps the teacher’s desk (depth 0.8) by ~0.1 m.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move it to the side of the desk: set position to x = –1.5, y = 0.3, z = –3.8, eliminating the overlap.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

All five fixes have been applied:

1. **dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  
2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  
3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  
4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  
5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  
6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  

Everything else remains as originally specified.

All five fixes have been applied:

1. **dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  
2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  
3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  
4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  
5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  
6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  

Everything else remains as originally specified.

**dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  \n2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  \n3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  \n4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  \n5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  \n6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  \n\nEverything else remains as originally specified.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Design the classroom space to accommodate 10 students with enough space for desks, chairs, and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks. Position all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Place all student chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create walls and floor for the classroom with light colors to give a bright atmosphere.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Design a tall bookshelf along one side wall filled with dinosaur-related books and models.\n- Place a large dinosaur skeleton model or replica near the back corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add two circular wall clocks on side walls.\n- Include a potted plant in one corner for a natural touch.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for good lighting.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall for natural light.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color student desks and chairs in natural wood tones with complementary color accents.\n- Position all objects without collisions and with enough walking space between desks and other items.\n- Ensure all furniture and decorations are placed on the floor or mounted as appropriate.\n- Make sure all student chairs face the dinosaur-themed board.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

All five fixes have been applied:

1. **dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  
2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  
3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  
4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  
5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  
6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  

Everything else remains as originally specified.

(0,180,0)  \n5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  \n6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  \n\nEverything else remains as originally specified.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Design the classroom space to accommodate 10 students with enough space for desks, chairs, and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks. Position all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Place all student chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create walls and floor for the classroom with light colors to give a bright atmosphere.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Design a tall bookshelf along one side wall filled with dinosaur-related books and models.\n- Place a large dinosaur skeleton model or replica near the back corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add two circular wall clocks on side walls.\n- Include a potted plant in one corner for a natural touch.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for good lighting.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall for natural light.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color student desks and chairs in natural wood tones with complementary color accents.\n- Position all objects without collisions and with enough walking space between desks and other items.\n- Ensure all furniture and decorations are placed on the floor or mounted as appropriate.\n- Make sure all student chairs face the dinosaur-themed board.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

All five fixes have been applied:

1. **dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  
2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  
3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  
4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  
5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  
6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  

Everything else remains as originally specified.

**dinosaur_skeleton** moved to z = 5.4  \n2. **student_desk6–10** shifted to z = 1.0  \n3. **student_chair6–10** shifted to z = 1.8  \n4. **bookshelf** relocated to (–4.0, 1.0, 5.8) with rotation (0,180,0)  \n5. **plant_foliage** now has an explicit position (–4.2, 0.9, –4.0)  \n6. **waste_bin1** moved to x = –1.5  \n\nEverything else remains as originally specified.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Design the classroom space to accommodate 10 students with enough space for desks, chairs, and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks. Position all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Place all student chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room on the floor, facing the student desks.\n- Add a large dinosaur-themed blackboard or whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create walls and floor for the classroom with light colors to give a bright atmosphere.\n- Add educational dinosaur posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Design a tall bookshelf along one side wall filled with dinosaur-related books and models.\n- Place a large dinosaur skeleton model or replica near the back corner of the classroom on the floor.\n- Add two circular wall clocks on side walls.\n- Include a potted plant in one corner for a natural touch.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for good lighting.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall for natural light.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Color student desks and chairs in natural wood tones with complementary color accents.\n- Position all objects without collisions and with enough walking space between desks and other items.\n- Ensure all furniture and decorations are placed on the floor or mounted as appropriate.\n- Make sure all student chairs face the dinosaur-themed board.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_poster4\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/dinosaur_poster4\', \'issue\': \'Collides with the window on the right wall (overlapping x and z extents).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move dinosaur_poster4 to position { x: 4.88, y: 1.5, z: 3.0 } so it sits above the window without overlapping.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'waste_bin2\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/waste_bin2\', \'issue\': \'Intersecting with the bookshelf behind it (overlapping bounding volumes).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust waste_bin2 position to { x: -4.0, y: 0.3, z: 5.2 } to clear the bookshelf area.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'Slightly embedded into the back wall by ~0.1 units.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move the bookshelf forward to { x: -4.0, y: 1.0, z: 5.7 } to sit flush against the wall without penetration.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}
