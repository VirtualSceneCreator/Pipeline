The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

Display units (1.5 m shelves, 1 m bookshelves) stand 2 m tall, while the blackboard (4 m wide × 1.5 m tall) and window/curtains (2 m × 1.5 m) maintain consistent thicknesses for wall mounts. Teacher and student desks occupy 2 m × 1 m and 1.2 m × 0.6 m footprints, respectively, with heights of 0.75 m; chairs follow at 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1 m and 0.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.9 m. Smaller elements (0.5 m × 0.7 m posters, 0.3 m × 0.3 m × 0.5 m figurines, 0.2 m × 0.2 m × 0.05 m lights) are kept shallow. Finally, walls at 3 m high (0.2 m thick) and a 12 m × 8 m floor (0.1 m thick) ensure the entire plan accommodates all furniture, exhibits, and required clearances.

[2025-05-18 23:40:20,152] INFO: Result:  I begin by anchoring the floor at the origin and surrounding it with four walls. I mount the blackboard centrally on the front wall and place the teacher’s desk 1 m in front at typical desk height, with the chair behind it facing the board. Along the left wall near the front corner I add the window with curtains. The student desks form two rows of five in the center, with chairs behind each facing forward. On the back-right corner stands the dinosaur skeleton on the floor, next to a display shelf with a dinosaur figurine on top. The bookshelf sits near the teacher’s desk to the left. I mount the poster on the back wall and suspend the light fixture in the grid above at 3 m. All items maintain at least 1 m clearance between interactive zones, align objects of the same type, and orient chairs toward their desks.

[2025-05-18 23:46:42,725] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in two rows of five desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design the walls with dinosaur-themed murals or posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a large 3D dinosaur skeleton model positioned on one side of the classroom, on the floor.
- Add several dinosaur models or figurines on shelves or display cases along the walls.
- Place a bookshelf filled with dinosaur books near the teacher's desk.
- Include a large window with dinosaur-themed curtains on one side wall.
- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Add a floor with the right size for the classroom and four walls surrounding the room.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy tones like brown and green to evoke a prehistoric atmosphere.
- Paint the walls in light neutral tones to enhance the brightness and contrast with the dinosaur decorations.
- Position all desks and chairs on the floor, with chairs facing the front wall.
- Make sure the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, teacher's desk, dinosaur exhibits, and other classroom furniture with no collisions.

[2025-05-18 23:50:22,389] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in two rows of five desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design the walls with dinosaur-themed murals or posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a large 3D dinosaur skeleton model positioned on one side of the classroom, on the floor.
- Add several dinosaur models or figurines on shelves or display cases along the walls.
- Place a bookshelf filled with dinosaur books near the teacher's desk.
- Include a large window with dinosaur-themed curtains on one side wall.
- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Add a floor with the right size for the classroom and four walls surrounding the room.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy tones like brown and green to evoke a prehistoric atmosphere.
- Paint the walls in light neutral tones to enhance the brightness and contrast with the dinosaur decorations.
- Position all desks and chairs on the floor, with chairs facing the front wall.
- Make sure the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, teacher's desk, dinosaur exhibits, and other classroom furniture with no collisions.

- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in two rows of five desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design the walls with dinosaur-themed murals or posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Create a large 3D dinosaur skeleton model positioned on one side of the classroom, on the floor.
- Add several dinosaur models or figurines on shelves or display cases along the walls.
- Place a bookshelf filled with dinosaur books near the teacher's desk.
- Include a large window with dinosaur-themed curtains on one side wall.
- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Add a floor with the right size for the classroom and four walls surrounding the room.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy tones like brown and green to evoke a prehistoric atmosphere.
- Paint the walls in light neutral tones to enhance the brightness and contrast with the dinosaur decorations.
- Position all desks and chairs on the floor, with chairs facing the front wall.
- Make sure the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, teacher's desk, dinosaur exhibits, and other classroom furniture with no collisions.

Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design the walls with dinosaur-themed murals or posters evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create a large 3D dinosaur skeleton model positioned on one side of the classroom, on the floor.\n- Add several dinosaur models or figurines on shelves or display cases along the walls.\n- Place a bookshelf filled with dinosaur books near the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a large window with dinosaur-themed curtains on one side wall.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.\n- Add a floor with the right size for the classroom and four walls surrounding the room.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy tones like brown and green to evoke a prehistoric atmosphere.\n- Paint the walls in light neutral tones to enhance the brightness and contrast with the dinosaur decorations.\n- Position all desks and chairs on the floor, with chairs facing the front wall.\n- Make sure the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between desks, teacher\'s desk, dinosaur exhibits, and other classroom furniture with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'teacher_desk\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/teacher_desk\', \'issue\': \'Desk is floating ~0.05m above the floor.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position Y to 0.40 (half of height 0.80) so it sits flush on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'teacher_chair\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/teacher_chair\', \'issue\': \'Chair is floating ~0.05m above the floor and placed too close to the desk (only ~0.1m walkway).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position to X=0.00, Y=0.50 (half of height 1.00), Z=-5.30 to sit on the floor and provide ~0.6m clearance behind the desk.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf1\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/bookshelf1\', \'issue\': \'Bookshelf is floating ~0.05m above the floor.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position Y to 1.00 (half of height 2.00) to rest on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'display_shelf1\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/display_shelf1\', \'issue\': \'Display shelf is floating ~0.05m above the floor.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position Y to 0.60 (half of height 1.20) to sit flush on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student_desk1 through student_desk10\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/student_desk[1–10]\', \'issue\': \'All student desks are floating ~0.05m above the floor.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position Y to 0.375 (half of height 0.75) on every student_desk to align with the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student_chair1 through student_chair10\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/student_chair[1–10]\', \'issue\': \'All student chairs are floating ~0.05m above the floor.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position Y to 0.45 (half of height 0.90) on every student_chair so they rest on the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dino_skeleton\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/dino_skeleton\', \'issue\': \'Skeleton intersects the right wall (extends ~0.1m beyond) and back wall, also overlapping the figurine area.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position to X=2.00, Y=1.25 (half of height 2.50), Z=5.55 (back wall interior 5.8 − half depth 0.25) to clear walls and decor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'dinosaur_figurine1\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/dinosaur_figurine1\', \'issue\': \'Figurine is placed in mid-air with no supporting shelf on the right side wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to the existing display_shelf1 location: set Position X=-4.20, Y=1.35, Z=5.75 so it sits on the shelf top.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'light_fixture1\', \'path\': \'Classroom_With_Dinosaur_Exhibit/objects/light_fixture1\', \'issue\': \'Only one ceiling light present — lighting will be uneven for a 10-student classroom.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Duplicate this fixture and place additional lights at e.g. (-3.0,3.45,-2.0), (3.0,3.45,-2.0), (-3.0,3.45,2.0), (3.0,3.45,2.0) for even coverage.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

The values must stay the same! For example position, rotation, dimensions ... MUST stay the same!\n- Try to create objectGroups, to group the objects in the json.\n- Fill the specification field. Write multiple long sentences, that will be forwarded to an \'3D Object Generator\'. The\n3D Object Generator will receive the specification field and creates a 3D Asset with your specification. Be as detailed as possible\nfor the specification. Use the styles as described in the action plan!\n- Create the same specification for the same types of items. For example: all student chairs are the same.\n- Dont write any coordinates or relations into the specification, only a visual description of the object should be in the specification!\n- Only use the valid json schema, see Examples. If there are any calculations or different json objects, convert them\ninto the valid schema.\n- Only return the filled json, nothing else!\n\n# Json schema\n{\n  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",\n  "$id": "http://example.com/my-3d-meta-language.schema.json",\n  "type": "object",\n  "title": "3D Scene Schema",\n  "description": "Beschreibung einer 3D-Szene mit Top-Level- und Kind-Objekten, Umgebungsinformationen und Objektgruppen.",\n  "additionalProperties": false,\n  "properties": {\n    "scene": {\n      "type": "object",\n      "description": "Haupteintrag für die Szene",\n      "additionalProperties": false,\n      "required": [\n        "sceneName",\n        "environment",\n        "objects"\n      ],\n      "properties": {\n        "sceneName": {\n          "type": "string",\n          "description": "Name oder Bezeichner der Szene"\n        },\n        "environment": {\n          "$ref": "#/definitions/environment",\n          "description": "Umgebungsinformationen (z.\u202fB. indoor, outdoor, Dimensionen)"\n        },\n        "objectGroups": {\n          "type": "object",\n          "description": "Liste der Objektgruppen mit spezifischen Farbeinstellungen.
