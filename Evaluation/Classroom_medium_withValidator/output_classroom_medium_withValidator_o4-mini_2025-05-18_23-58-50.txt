The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5.

Educational elements and displays (blackboard, mural, skeletons, posters, bookshelf and globe) are mounted on walls or placed in corners to frame the learning space. Overhead lighting is arranged in two regular rows, and a window with curtains added to the left wall for natural light. Small items like waste bins are tucked near the teacher’s area and back wall. Throughout, I ensure clear walking aisles, consistent orientations (chairs face forward), and alignment across rows and wall-mounted items.

Student desks are sized at 0.8 m × 0.6 m × 0.75 m so that five in a row plus four 1.2 m gaps fit within 10 m, with chairs (0.45 m × 0.45 m × 0.9 m) behind each desk. A 1.5 m aisle between the two rows keeps a clear path. The teacher’s station is larger (1.6 m × 0.8 m × 0.75 m desk and 0.6 m × 0.6 m × 1.2 m chair) at the front. A 4 m × 1.2 m blackboard goes above that. Decorative elements—4 skeletons at 2 m × 1 m × 2 m, a 4 m × 2.5 m mural, six posters at 0.6 m × 0.9 m, a 1.2 m × 0.3 m × 2 m bookshelf, a 0.6 m globe, six 0.4 m × 0.05 m lights, a 2 m × 1.5 m window

Educational elements and displays (blackboard, mural, skeletons, posters, bookshelf and globe) are mounted on walls or placed in corners to frame the learning space. Overhead lighting is arranged in two regular rows, and a window with curtains added to the left wall for natural light. Small items like waste bins are tucked near the teacher’s area and back wall. Throughout, I ensure clear walking aisles, consistent orientations (chairs face forward), and alignment across rows and wall-mounted items.\n\nFloor | middle\n\nWall_Front | edge | face to,

[2025-05-18 23:40:32,327] INFO: Input Action Plan:  Instantiate and place GameObjects in Unity:
1. Create an empty parent GameObject ‘Classroom’.
2. Under Classroom, create Floor and Walls (Front, Back, Left, Right) with positions and rotations.
3. Create Student_Desk1–Student_Desk10 as child of Classroom; assign box colliders and materials; position and rotate per relation plan.
4. Create Student_Chair1–Student_Chair10 similarly; attach as children of Classroom; set orientation.
5. Create Teacher_Desk and Teacher_Chair; set as children; apply contrasting material.
6. Create Blackboard as a plane; parent to Wall_Front; position flush with wall; apply blackboard material.
7. Create Wall_Mural as a textured quad; parent to Wall_Right; apply dinosaur mural texture.
8. Create Dinosaur_Skeleton1–4 using primitives or imported models; parent to Classroom; position at four corners.
9. Create Educational_Poster1–6 as quads with poster textures; parent to respective walls; align.
10. Create Bookshelf using primitives; parent to Wall_Left; add shelves as children; populate with simple cube books.
11. Create Dinosaur_Globe as sphere with painted texture; place on Bookshelf.
12. Instantiate Ceiling_Light1–6 as point lights with fixture geometry; set intensity; parent to Classroom; place at ceiling height.
13. Create Window and Curtains as quads; parent to Wall_Left; apply window glass and curtain materials.
14. Create Waste_Bin1, Waste_Bin2 as cylinders; parent to Classroom; position near teacher desk and back.
15. Assign materials and colors: earthy tones on student desks/chairs; light walls/floor with green/brown accents; contrasting color on teacher set.
16. Add BoxColliders to all static geometry; NavMesh or collision boundaries ensure free walking space.
17. Final check: validate no overlapping colliders; chairs face north (front) so students face blackboard.
18. Save Scene ‘DinoClassroom’ in Unity Assets folder.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.

Educational elements and displays (blackboard, mural, skeletons, posters, bookshelf and globe) are mounted on walls or placed in corners to frame the learning space. Overhead lighting is arranged in two regular rows, and a window with curtains added to the left wall for natural light. Small items like waste bins are tucked near the teacher’s area and back wall. Throughout, I ensure clear walking aisles, consistent orientations (chairs face forward), and alignment across rows and wall-mounted items.\n\nFloor | middle\n\nWall_Front | edge | face to,

[2025-05-18 23:45:36,226] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall size of the classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.
- Place a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.
- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.
- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.
- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.
- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher's desk or bookshelf.
- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.
- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.
- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.
- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.
- Design the teacher's desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.

comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.\n- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.\n- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.\n- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher\'s desk or bookshelf.\n- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.\n- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.\n- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.\n- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design the teacher\'s desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.',

[2025-05-18 23:49:55,009] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall size of the classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.
- Place a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.
- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.
- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.
- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.
- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher's desk or bookshelf.
- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.
- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.
- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.
- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.
- Design the teacher's desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.

students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.\n- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.\n- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.\n- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher\'s desk or bookshelf.\n- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.\n- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.\n- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.\n- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design the teacher\'s desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'Floor\', \'path\': \'DinoClassroom/Floor\', \'issue\': \'Floor is at y=0, so its top surface sits at y=0.05 (half

[2025-05-18 23:51:57,904] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall size of the classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.
- Place a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.
- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.
- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.
- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.
- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher's desk or bookshelf.
- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.
- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.
- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.
- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.
- Design the teacher's desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.

classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.\n- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.\n- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.\n- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher\'s desk or bookshelf.\n- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.\n- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.\n- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.\n- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design the teacher\'s desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.',

classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.\n- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.\n- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.\n- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher\'s desk or bookshelf.\n- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.\n- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.\n- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.\n- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design the teacher\'s desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.',

[2025-05-18 23:55:10,364] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall size of the classroom to comfortably accommodate 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.
- Place a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.
- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.
- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.
- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.
- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.
- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher's desk or bookshelf.
- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.
- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.
- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.
- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.
- Design the teacher's desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.

desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 student desks arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, with chairs, placed on the floor with adequate space between them.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks.\n- Create a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design a dinosaur-themed wall mural or large framed picture on one side wall to set the theme of dinosaurs.\n- Add dinosaur skeleton models or replicas made from suitable 3D shapes, positioned at corners or along the side walls without blocking walking paths.\n- Place dinosaur-related educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the remaining walls.\n- Include a bookshelf stocked with dinosaur books and educational materials along one side wall.\n- Create a dinosaur-themed globe or model of a prehistoric environment near the teacher\'s desk or bookshelf.\n- Design ceiling lights evenly spaced to brightly illuminate the classroom.\n- Position a large window with curtains on one wall to allow natural light.\n- Add two waste bins placed near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Create a floor and four walls enclosing the classroom, with no ceiling.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front of the room towards the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Color the student desks and chairs in earthy, natural tones to match the dinosaur theme.\n- Use light-colored walls and floor with some green and brown accents to create a prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design the teacher\'s desk and chair in a contrasting color for visibility.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between desks, dinosaur models, bookshelf, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue
