The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

[2025-05-20 14:49:11,885] INFO: Result:  I begin by anchoring the scene with the floor and surrounding walls, then mount the blackboard centrally on the front wall. The teacher’s desk is positioned in front of the blackboard, followed by two rows of student desks and their corresponding chairs, all facing the teacher. Larger decorative elements such as the three dinosaur models are tucked into the corners, while posters line the walls. A bookshelf and globe are placed near the teacher’s area, potted plants populate the four corners, and ceiling lights form a 4x4 grid overhead. A wall clock adorns the right wall, and waste bins are placed near the desk and at the back wall. This layered, front-to-back approach ensures logical dependencies and clear sight-lines.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

[2025-05-20 14:57:48,855] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.
- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Add a teacher's desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.
- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.
- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.
- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.
- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.
- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.
- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.
- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.
- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.

space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Add a teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.\n- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.\n- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.\n- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.\n- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.\n- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.\n- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.\n- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name':

[2025-05-20 15:00:05,360] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.
- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Add a teacher's desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.
- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.
- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.
- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.
- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.
- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.
- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.
- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.
- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.

plan:\n- Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Add a teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.\n- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.\n- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.\n- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.\n- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.\n- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.\n- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.\n- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.\n[Conversation

[2025-05-20 15:02:34,039] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.
- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Add a teacher's desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.
- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.
- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.
- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.
- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.
- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.
- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.
- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.
- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.

as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the

[2025-05-20 15:04:20,343] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.
- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Add a teacher's desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.
- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.
- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.
- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.
- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.
- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.
- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.
- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.
- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.

as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Add a teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.\n- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.\n- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.\n- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.\n- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.\n- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.\n- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.\n- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs':

[2025-05-20 15:06:22,465] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Design the classroom with appropriate size for 10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.
- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.
- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.
- Add a teacher's desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.
- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.
- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.
- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.
- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.
- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.
- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.
- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.
- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.
- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher's desk and blackboard.
- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.

as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Add a teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.\n- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.\n- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.\n- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.\n- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.\n- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.\n- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.\n- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_left\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_left\', \'issue\': \'Wall orientation is incorrect (rotation y=90°)

10 students, ensuring enough space between desks and aisles for comfort and movement.\n- Create 10 student desks as individual rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each, placed on the floor with sufficient walking space between them.\n- Position all student desks and chairs facing the front of the classroom.\n- Add a teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room, facing the student desks.\n- Include a large blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a classroom floor textured to look like soil or stone to reflect the dinosaur theme.\n- Create walls enclosing the classroom with a natural earthy or forest green color theme.\n- Add dinosaur-themed decorations: create 3 dinosaur models of varying sizes placed strategically around the classroom (e.g., near walls or corners), scaled to be noticeable but not obstructive.\n- Mount dinosaur-related educational posters or murals on the side and back walls.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with dinosaur-related books along one side wall.\n- Add a large globe or model of prehistoric Earth on a stand near the teacher’s desk.\n- Place some potted plants around the room to simulate a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced for proper illumination.\n- Put a circular wall clock on one wall.\n- Add waste bins near teacher’s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the teacher\'s desk and blackboard.\n- Set color schemes with natural, earthy tones and vibrant dinosaur-related colors.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, keeping space clear and without collisions.\n[Conversation finished]\nPut this scene into the json format:
