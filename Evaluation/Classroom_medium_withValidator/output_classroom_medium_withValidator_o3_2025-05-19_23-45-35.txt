The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

Floor and walls: Place \'floor\' at origin. Surround with \'wall_front\', \'wall_back\', \'wall_left\', \'wall_right\'.\n2. Teacher’s area: Place \'teacher_desk\' 1 m from front wall center. Place \'blackboard\' 0.1 m above teacher_desk on \'wall_front\'.\n3. Student desks and chairs: Arrange 10 desks in 2 rows of 5:\n   - Row spacing: 1 m front clearance to teacher’s desk + desk depth (0.6 m) + 1.2 m aisle, then another row. \n   - Column spacing: Each desk 1.2 m width plus 0.8 m between.\n   - Place each \'student_chair\' 0.2 m behind its desk, all facing front.\n4. Posters and charts: Evenly space 4 \'dinosaur_poster\' on \'wall_left\' and 4 on \'wall_back\'. Height at 1.5 m from floor.\n5. Sculptures: Place 2 \'dino_sculpture\' per side wall: at left/back corners on pedestals 0.5 m from walls.\n6. Footprint decals: Create a path from classroom entrance (back) to \'blackboard\': place \'footprint_decal\' every 1 m along centerline.\n7. Display cabinet: Place 3 \'display_cabinet\' evenly along \'wall_right\' with 1 m gaps.\n8. Projector: Mount \'projector\' at ceiling center, 0.1 m below ceiling, aligned with blackboard center.\n9. Clock: Place \'wall_clock\' on \'wall_right\', 1.8 m high, 1 m from wall_front.\n10. Potted plants: Place 2 \'potted_plant\' near corners by \'wall_left\' and \'wall_back\'.\n11. Ceiling lights: Evenly space 6 \'ceiling_light\' in 2 rows of 3 across the ceiling plane.\n12. Window: Place \'window_with_curtains\' on \'wall_left\', centered in the second bay between posters.\n13. Waste bins: Place \'waste_bin\' 0.2 m right of \'teacher_desk\', and another 0.5 m from entrance on \'wall_back\'.\n14. Color scheme: Assign earthy brown to desks, green to chairs, walls in light olive, floor in muted brown, ceiling lights in off-white.\n15. Ensure no overlaps and maintain aisles of at least 0.8 m between objects. Use local coordinates relative to floor origin at classroom center.\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor\', \'wall_front\', \'wall_back\', \'wall_left\', \'wall_right\', \'teacher_desk\', \'blackboard\', \'student_desk\', \'student_chair\', \'dinosaur_poster\', \'dino_sculpture\', \'footprint_decal\', \'display_cabinet\', \'projector\', \'wall_clock\', \'potted_plant\', \'ceiling_light\', \'window_with_curtains\', \'waste_bin\']\n            use these objects and their sizes [\'student_desk size:1.2x0.75x0.6\', \'student_chair size:0.5x0.9x0.5\', \'teacher_desk size:1.8x0.75x0.8\', \'blackboard size:4.0x1.5x0.05\', \'dinosaur_poster size:0.6x0.8x0.02\', \'dino_sculpture size:0.8x2.2x0.8\', \'footprint_decal size:0.5x0.01x0.3\', \'display_cabinet size:1.5x2.0x0.5\', \'projector size:0.3x0.1x0.25\', \'wall_clock size:0.4x0.4x0.05\', \'potted_plant size:0.6x1.2x0.6\', \'ceiling_light size:0.6x0.1x0.6\', \'window_with_curtains size:2.0x1.6x0.3\', \'waste_bin size:0.3x0.5x0.3\', \'wall_front size:7.5x3.0x0.2\', \'wall_back size:7.5x3.0x0.2\', \'wall_left size:10.0x3.0x0.2\', \'wall_right size:10.0x3.0x0.2\', \'floor size:7.5x0.1x10.0\']'}], 'model': 'o3', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-19 23:32:53,960] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.
- Create a teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.
- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.
- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.
- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.
- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.
- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Add waste bins next to the teacher's desk and near the entrance.
- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.
- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.
- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.
- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.
- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

[2025-05-19 23:35:05,441] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.
- Create a teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.
- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.
- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.
- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.
- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.
- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Add waste bins next to the teacher's desk and near the entrance.
- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.
- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.
- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.
- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.
- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

tool_call_id=\'call_s8ZlWK4nQhbCuwQJikPdHH1s\'\nThis was the action plan:\n- Determine the classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.\n- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.\n- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.\n- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.\n- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.\n- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Add waste bins next to the teacher\'s desk and near the entrance.\n- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.\n- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.\n- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.\n- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'teacher_desk\', \'path\':

[2025-05-19 23:36:34,260] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the classroom size suitable for 10 students with enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.
- Create a teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.
- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.
- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.
- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.
- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.
- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Add waste bins next to the teacher's desk and near the entrance.
- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.
- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.
- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.
- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.
- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

aisles.\n- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.\n- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.\n- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.\n- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.\n- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.\n- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Add waste bins next to the teacher\'s desk and near the entrance.\n- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.\n- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.\n- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.\n- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.
- Create a teacher's desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.
- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.
- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.
- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.
- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.
- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.
- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Add waste bins next to the teacher's desk and near the entrance.
- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.
- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.
- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.
- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.
- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

aisles.\n- Create 10 individual student desks with chairs arranged in 2 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with appropriate clear space between desks for comfortable movement.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the students.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.\n- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.\n- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.\n- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.\n- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.\n- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Add waste bins next to the teacher\'s desk and near the entrance.\n- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.\n- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.\n- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.\n- Create four walls to enclose the classroom.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_clock\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_clock\', \'issue\': \'The wall_clock is floating away from the front wall surface and its width extends beyond the right wall boundary.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move its center to x = 3.625, y = 1.8, z = -4.875 so it sits flush on the inside face of the front wall (wall depth 0.2 → inside face at z = -4.9; clock half-depth 0.025).

students.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Design classroom walls with dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add dinosaur models or sculptures on pedestals near the walls, including different species for visual interest; place them on the floor with enough walking space around.\n- Incorporate realistic dinosaur footprints stickers or decals on the floor guiding towards key points like the blackboard or exhibits.\n- Create display cabinets or shelves along one wall containing fossil replicas, dinosaur bones, and relevant books.\n- Include a digital projector mounted on the ceiling aligned with the blackboard.\n- Place a wall-mounted clock on a visible side wall.\n- Add several potted plants to bring a natural prehistoric ambiance.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the classroom.\n- Create a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Add waste bins next to the teacher\'s desk and near the entrance.\n- Use earthy colors such as browns and greens for desks, chairs, and walls to evoke a natural prehistoric theme.\n- Make sure all chairs face the front blackboard.\n- Create a floor sized appropriately for all these objects to fit comfortably.\n- Create four walls to enclose the
