The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a fair booth.

[2025-05-23 18:04:35,576] INFO: Result:  To create a clear and functional booth layout, I first establish the room’s boundaries by placing the floor and three walls. I then position the registration desk at the front center just inside the entry, leaving an 0.8 m aisle behind. Display stands go along the side walls with 0.8 m clearance to avoid obstructing entry or exit. The presentation table sits at the geometric center with chairs arranged around it at 0.8 m distance, all facing the table. Banners hang from the top edges of each wall for visibility, while potted plants occupy the four internal corners for greenery. Spotlights are installed directly above the registration desk and presentation table, and colorful balloons float in the upper air for a festive touch. The scheme uses orange/red for the registration desk and banners, neutral white for the walls, and green for the plants.

- Determine an appropriate conference room size to accommodate typical seating, a presentation area, and circulation space.
- Create a rectangular floor representing the conference room base.
- Create four walls around the floor, each wall with appropriate height.
- Add a large rectangular conference table centered in the room, sized to seat 12 people comfortably.
- Create 12 office chairs arranged evenly around the conference table, ensuring each chair faces the table and has enough space to be pulled out without collision.
- Place a large wall-mounted flat-screen display on one of the longer walls, centered and at a comfortable viewing height.
- Add a speakerphone or conference call device on the conference table, centered.
- Create a side cabinet or credenza along one short wall, for storage and placing presentation materials.
- Add a flipchart stand or whiteboard mounted on a side wall, with enough space around it for user access.
- Install adjustable ceiling lights evenly spaced above the conference table for optimal lighting.
- Place a few potted plants in corners to add greenery and decoration.
- Include a floor carpet or rug under the conference table and chairs to define the seating area.
- Paint walls in neutral light colors; color the floor with a complementary tone to create a professional atmosphere.
- Ensure there is clear walk space around the table and chairs for circulation without collisions.
- All furniture and devices should be placed on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.

Each wall should be 3 meters high.\n- Add a branded registration desk at the front center of the booth, positioned just inside the open entry. The desk should be 1.5 meters wide, 0.7 meters deep, and 1 meter high.\n- Place two vertical display stands inside the booth, near each side wall but not blocking entry or exit. Each stand is 0.5 meters wide, 0.5 meters deep, and 1.8 meters tall.\n- Create a central presentation table measuring 2 meters by 1 meter with four chairs arranged around it for visitor interaction.\n- Add hanging banners suspended from the top edges of the booth walls, each banner sized 1 meter wide and 2 meters tall.\n- Position four decorative potted plants near wall corners inside the booth to add natural elements.\n- Install overhead spotlights centered over the presentation table and registration desk for focal lighting.\n- Scatter some floating balloons in vibrant colors above the booth area for a festive feel.\n- Make sure aisles within the booth are at least 0.8 meters wide for visitor movement, and chairs are oriented towards the presentation table.\n- Color scheme: use warm tones like orange and red for the registration desk and banners, neutral white for booth walls, and natural green for plants.\n[Conversation finished]\nPut this scene into the json
