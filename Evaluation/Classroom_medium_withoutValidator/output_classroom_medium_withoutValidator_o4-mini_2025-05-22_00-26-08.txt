The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom for 10 students suitable for a subject about dinosaurs.

We anchor on a standard student desk (1.2 m × 0.6 m × 0.75 m) with matching 0.5 m × 0.5 m × 1.0 m chairs. Two rows of five desks with 1.0 m between desks and 1.5 m side clearances yield an interior width of ~11 m. Depth from the front wall to back wall combines a minimal front clearance (0.5 m), a teacher’s desk (0.8 m), front-row clearance (1.0 m), both desk rows (2 × 0.6 m), mid-row clearance (1.0 m), and back clearance (1.5 m) for ~6 m total. Ceiling height is set at 3 m. Using these anchors, we proportion all other elements—teacher’s desk, chairs, whiteboard, projector, posters, dinosaur models, bookshelves, potted plants, lighting, clock, waste bins, walls, ceiling, and floor—so they fit coherently with clear walkways and thematic balance.

Two rows of five desks with 1.0 m between desks and 1.5 m side clearances yield an interior width of ~11 m. Depth from the front wall to back wall combines a minimal front clearance (0.5 m), a teacher’s desk (0.8 m), front-row clearance (1.0 m), both desk rows (2 × 0.6 m), mid-row clearance (1.0 m), and back clearance (1.5 m) for ~6 m total. Ceiling height is set at 3 m. Using these anchors, we proportion all other elements—teacher’s desk, chairs, whiteboard, projector, posters, dinosaur models, bookshelves, potted plants, lighting, clock, waste bins, walls, ceiling, and floor—so they fit coherently with clear walkways and thematic

I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2.

[2025-05-22 00:17:41,472] INFO: Result:  My approach is to establish the room’s shell first, using walls, floor, and ceiling as fixed anchors. Next, I place the teacher’s desk and chair close to the front wall for direct interaction with the whiteboard and wall clock. The projector is ceiling-mounted toward the rear. Student desks are organized into two evenly spaced rows, with chairs positioned immediately next to them and facing inward. Posters are clustered on side and back walls at eye level. A central T-Rex display anchors the back, flanked by bookshelves and smaller dinosaur figures on side walls. Potted plants occupy corners for balance, ceiling lights are evenly distributed, and waste bins are placed near the teacher’s area. This ensures clear sight lines, balanced symmetry, and functional groupings.

Next, I place the teacher’s desk and chair close to the front wall for direct interaction with the whiteboard and wall clock. The projector is ceiling-mounted toward the rear. Student desks are organized into two evenly spaced rows, with chairs positioned immediately next to them and facing inward. Posters are clustered on side and back walls at eye level. A central T-Rex display anchors the back, flanked by bookshelves and smaller dinosaur figures on side walls. Potted plants occupy corners for balance, ceiling lights are evenly distributed, and waste bins are placed near the teacher’s area. This ensures clear sight lines, balanced symmetry, and functional groupings.\n\nfrontWall | front  \nbackWall | back  \nleftWall | side, left  \nrightWall | side, right  \nfloor | middle  \nceiling | middle  \nteacherDesk | middle | near, frontWall | face to, backWall  \nteacherChair | middle | near, teacherDesk | face to, teacherDesk  \nwhiteboard | front | side of, frontWall | air  \nwallClock | front | side of, frontWall | air  \nprojector | middle | on top of, ceiling | top  \nstudentDesk1 | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk2 | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk3 | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk4 | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk5 | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk6 | middle | ground | far, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk7 | middle | ground | far, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk8 | middle | ground | far, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk9 | middle | ground | far, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentDesk10 | middle | ground | far, teacherDesk | in front of, teacherDesk  \nstudentChair1 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk1 | face to, studentDesk1  \nstudentChair2 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk2 | face to, studentDesk2  \nstudentChair3 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk3 | face to, studentDesk3  \nstudentChair4 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk4 | face to, studentDesk4  \nstudentChair5 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk5 | face to, studentDesk5  \nstudentChair6 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk6 | face to, studentDesk6  \nstudentChair7 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk7 | face to, studentDesk7  \nstudentChair8 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk8 | face to, studentDesk8  \nstudentChair9 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk9 | face to, studentDesk9  \nstudentChair10 | middle | ground | near, studentDesk10 | face to, studentDesk10  \nposter1 | edge | side of, leftWall | air  \nposter2 | edge | side of, leftWall | air  \nposter3 | edge | side of, leftWall | air  \nposter4 | edge | side of, leftWall | air  \nposter5 | edge | side of, backWall | air  \nposter6 | edge | side of, backWall | air  \nposter7 | edge | side of, backWall | air  \nposter8 | edge | side of, backWall | air  \nT_Rex | middle | ground | near, backWall | in front of, backWall  \nbookshelf1 | edge | ground | near, leftWall  \nbookshelf2 | edge | ground | near, rightWall  \ndinoSmall1 | edge | on top of, bookshelf1  \ndinoSmall2 | edge | on top of, bookshelf2  \ndinoSmall3 | middle | on top of, teacherDesk  \ndinoSmall4 | middle | ground  \npottedPlant1 | edge | ground | near, leftWall  \npottedPlant2 | edge | ground | near, rightWall  \npottedPlant3 | edge | ground | near, rightWall  \nceilingLight1 | middle | on top of, ceiling | top  \nceilingLight2 | middle | on top of, ceiling | top  \nceilingLight3 | middle | on top of, ceiling | top  \nceilingLight4 | middle | on top of, ceiling | top  \nwasteBin_front | middle | ground | near, teacherDesk | near, frontWall  \nwasteBin_back | middle | ground | near, backWall', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_QFGyLZoajwpyaQb2nrJfUV02'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'stream': False, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'game_objects_size_module', 'description': 'Returns a plan for the specific zones in the fair booth.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'action_plan': {'description': 'The action plan to create the zones', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['action_plan'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'relation_module', 'description': 'Returns a plan for the specific zones in the fair booth.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'objects': {'description': 'List of the objects, that will be placed in the unity scene', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'type': 'array'}, 'action_plan': {'description': 'The action plan with details of the relations', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objects', 'action_plan'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'object_placement_module', 'description': 'Returns the specific objects placed in the 3D World.

Next, I place the teacher’s desk and chair close to the front wall for direct interaction with the whiteboard and wall clock. The projector is ceiling-mounted toward the rear. Student desks are organized into two evenly spaced rows, with chairs positioned immediately next to them and facing inward. Posters are clustered on side and back walls at eye level. A central T-Rex display anchors the back, flanked by bookshelves and smaller dinosaur figures on side walls. Potted plants occupy corners for balance, ceiling lights are evenly distributed, and waste bins are placed near the teacher’s area. This ensures clear sight lines, balanced symmetry, and functional groupings.\n\nfrontWall | front  \nbackWall | back  \nleftWall | side, left  \nrightWall | side, right  \nfloor | middle  \nceiling |

Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Create a large rectangular whiteboard or blackboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the whiteboard/blackboard.\n- Add dinosaur-themed educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Create dinosaur models or sculptures in various sizes placed strategically around the classroom to stimulate interest. For example, a large T-Rex model near the entrance and smaller dinosaur models on shelves or tables.\n- Add bookshelves filled with dinosaur-related books placed along one side wall.\n- Place a few potted plants to give a naturalistic feel, simulating a prehistoric environment.\n- Incorporate ambient lighting designed to highlight dinosaur models and posters, using ceiling lights with a warm tone.\n- Add a wall clock and waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and in the back of the classroom.\n- Design a floor with a neutral tone, walls painted in light earthy colors (e.g., shades of beige, green) to fit the dinosaur theme.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the teacher and whiteboard/blackboard.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate, with enough walking space and no collisions.\n- Create four walls and a ceiling for the classroom.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher\'s desk and chair
