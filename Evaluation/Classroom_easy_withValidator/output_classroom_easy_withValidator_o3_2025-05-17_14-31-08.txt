The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

[2025-05-17 14:06:52,653] INFO: Result:  High-Level Size Strategy

I begin with the floor as the anchor element—8 × 10 × 0.1 m—establishing the room footprint and ensuring all elements have sufficient real estate. The ceiling duplicates this 8 × 10 footprint at 0.1 m thickness, sitting at a 3 m height. Walls enclose the space with heights of 3 m and thicknesses of 0.2 m, matching the floor plan.

For student furniture, desks at 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.75 m fit in three rows of five across the 8 m width (5 × 0.8 = 4 m of desks, leaving at least 1 m clearance on each side, plus 1 m aisles between rows). Lengthwise, three desk rows plus aisles and a 1 m buffer at both the teacher zone and back wall occupy ~7.6 m of the 10 m depth, leaving additional margin. Chairs at 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 m slide under each desk with room to spare.

The teacher’s desk (1.5 × 0.8 × 0.75 m) and chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 m) live at the front, leaving a 1 m passage to the 4 × 1.5 × 0.1 m blackboard. A 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.15 m projector hangs overhead. Storage and decorative units—two 1 × 0.4 × 2 m bookshelves, six 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.02 m posters, four 1 × 1.5 × 0.1 m windows, one 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.05 m clock, two 0.6 × 0.6 × 1 m plants, six 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 m lights, and two 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 m bins—are sized uniformly to fit along walls and ceiling without crowding. This hierarchy of sizes guarantees a coherent, navigable classroom.

The ceiling duplicates this 8 × 10 footprint at 0.1 m thickness, sitting at a 3 m height. Walls enclose the space with heights of 3 m and thicknesses of 0.2 m, matching the floor plan.\n\nFor student furniture, desks at 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.75 m fit in three rows of five across the 8 m width (5 × 0.8 = 4 m of desks, leaving at least 1 m clearance on each side, plus 1 m aisles between rows). Lengthwise, three desk rows plus aisles and a 1 m buffer at both the teacher zone and back wall occupy ~7.6 m of the 10 m depth, leaving additional margin. Chairs at 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 m slide under each desk with room to spare.\n\nThe teacher’s desk (1.5 × 0.8 × 0.75 m) and chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 m) live at the front, leaving a 1 m passage to the 4 × 1.5 × 0.1 m blackboard. A 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.15 m projector hangs overhead. Storage and decorative units—two 1 × 0.4 × 2 m bookshelves, six 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.02 m posters, four 1 × 1.5 × 0.1 m windows, one 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.05 m clock, two 0.6 × 0.6 × 1 m plants, six 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 m lights, and two 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 m bins—are sized uniformly to fit along walls and ceiling without crowding.

I place the teacher’s desk and chair near the front wall, with the blackboard and projector mounted on that wall and ceiling. Bookshelves, posters, windows, and the clock are flush on their respective walls. Student desks are arranged in three aligned rows with matching chairs facing forward. Finally, I add potted plants in the back corners, evenly spaced ceiling lights, and waste bins near the teacher area and back corner.

The ceiling duplicates this 8 × 10 footprint at 0.1 m thickness, sitting at a 3 m height. Walls enclose the space with heights of 3 m and thicknesses of 0.2 m, matching the floor plan.\n\nFor student furniture, desks at 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.75 m fit in three rows of five across the 8 m width (5 × 0.8 = 4 m of desks, leaving at least 1 m clearance on each side, plus 1 m aisles between rows). Lengthwise, three desk rows plus aisles and a 1 m buffer at both the teacher zone and back wall occupy ~7.6 m of the 10 m depth, leaving additional margin. Chairs at 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 m slide under each desk with room to spare.\n\nThe teacher’s desk (1.5 × 0.8 × 0.75 m) and chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 m) live at the front, leaving a 1 m passage to the 4 × 1.5 × 0.1 m blackboard. A 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.15 m projector hangs overhead. Storage and decorative units—two 1 × 0.4 × 2 m bookshelves, six 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.02 m posters, four 1 × 1.5 × 0.1 m windows, one 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.05 m clock, two 0.6 × 0.6 × 1 m plants, six 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 m lights, and two 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 m bins—are sized uniformly to fit along walls and ceiling without crowding.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.

The ceiling duplicates this 8 × 10 footprint at 0.1 m thickness, sitting at a 3 m height. Walls enclose the space with heights of 3 m and thicknesses of 0.2 m, matching the floor plan.\n\nFor student furniture, desks at 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.75 m fit in three rows of five across the 8 m width (5 × 0.8 = 4 m of desks, leaving at least 1 m clearance on each side, plus 1 m aisles between rows). Lengthwise, three desk rows plus aisles and a 1 m buffer at both the teacher zone and back wall occupy ~7.6 m of the 10 m depth, leaving additional margin. Chairs at 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 m slide under each desk with room to spare.\n\nThe teacher’s desk (1.5 × 0.8 × 0.75 m) and chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 m) live at the front, leaving a 1 m passage to the 4 × 1.5 × 0.1 m blackboard.

- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

The ceiling duplicates this 8 × 10 footprint at 0.1 m thickness, sitting at a 3 m height. Walls enclose the space with heights of 3 m and thicknesses of 0.2 m, matching the floor plan.\n\nFor student furniture, desks at 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.75 m fit in three rows of five across the 8 m width (5 × 0.8 = 4 m of desks, leaving at least 1 m clearance on each side, plus 1 m aisles between rows). Lengthwise, three desk rows plus aisles and a 1 m buffer at both the teacher zone and back wall occupy ~7.6 m of the 10 m depth, leaving additional margin. Chairs at 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 m slide under each desk with room to spare.\n\nThe teacher’s desk (1.5 × 0.8 × 0.75 m) and chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 m) live at the front, leaving a 1 m passage to the 4 × 1.5 × 0.1 m blackboard. A 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.15 m projector hangs overhead. Storage and decorative units—two 1 × 0.4 × 2 m bookshelves, six 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.02 m posters, four 1 × 1.5 × 0.1 m windows, one 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.05 m clock, two 0.6 × 0.6 × 1 m plants, six 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 m lights, and two 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 m bins—are sized uniformly to fit along walls and ceiling without crowding.

Finally, I add potted plants in the back corners, evenly spaced ceiling lights, and waste bins near the teacher area and back corner.\n\nfloor | middle  \nwall_front | front | air  \nwall_back | back | air  \nwall_left | side, left | air | rotated  \nwall_right | side, right | air | rotated  \nceiling | middle | top  \nteacher_desk1 | front | near, wall_front | ground  \nteacher_chair1 | front | near, teacher_desk1 | face to, teacher_desk1 | ground  \nblackboard1 | front | side of, wall_front | center aligned, wall_front | air  \nprojector1 | front | on top of, ceiling | face to, blackboard1 | air  \nbookshelf1 | side, left | side of, wall_left | air  \nbookshelf2 | side, right | side of, wall_right | air  \nwall_clock1 | side, right | side of, wall_right | air  \neducational_poster1 | side, left | side of, wall_left | air  \neducational_poster2 | side, left | side of, wall_left | air  \neducational_poster3 | side, left | side of, wall_left | air  \neducational_poster4 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \neducational_poster5 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \neducational_poster6 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \nwindow1 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \nwindow2 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \nwindow3 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \nwindow4 | back | side of, wall_back | air  \npotted_plant1 | back | near, wall_back | near, wall_left | ground  \npotted_plant2 | back | near, wall_back | near, wall_right | ground  \nceiling_light_fixture1 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nceiling_light_fixture2 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nceiling_light_fixture3 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nceiling_light_fixture4 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nceiling_light_fixture5 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nceiling_light_fixture6 | middle | on top of, ceiling | air  \nwaste_bin1 | front | near, teacher_desk1 | ground  \nwaste_bin2 | back | near, wall_back | ground  \nstudent_desk1 | middle | ground | in front of, teacher_desk1  \nstudent_desk2 | middle | ground | in front of, teacher_desk1 | center aligned, student_desk1  \nstudent_desk3 | middle | ground | in front of, teacher_desk1 | center aligned, student_desk2  \nstudent_desk4 | middle | ground | in front of, teacher_desk1 | center aligned, student_desk3  \nstudent_desk5 | middle | ground | in front of, teacher_desk1 | center aligned, student_desk4  \nstudent_desk6 | middle | ground | far, student_desk1 | center aligned, student_desk1  \nstudent_desk7 | middle | ground | far, student_desk2 | center aligned, student_desk2  \nstudent_desk8 | middle | ground | far, student_desk3 | center aligned, student_desk3  \nstudent_desk9 | middle | ground | far, student_desk4 | center aligned, student_desk4  \nstudent_desk10 | middle | ground | far, student_desk5 | center aligned, student_desk5  \nstudent_desk11 | middle | ground | far, student_desk6 | center aligned, student_desk6  \nstudent_desk12 | middle | ground | far, student_desk7 | center aligned, student_desk7  \nstudent_desk13 | middle | ground | far, student_desk8 | center aligned, student_desk8  \nstudent_desk14 | middle | ground | far, student_desk9 | center aligned, student_desk9  \nstudent_desk15 | middle | ground | far, student_desk10 | center aligned, student_desk10  \nstudent_chair1 | middle | near, student_desk1 | face to, student_desk1 | ground  \nstudent_chair2 | middle | near, student_desk2 | face to, student_desk2 | ground  \nstudent_chair3 | middle | near, student_desk3 | face to, student_desk3 | ground  \nstudent_chair4 | middle | near, student_desk4 | face to, student_desk4 | ground  \nstudent_chair5 | middle | near, student_desk5 | face to, student_desk5 | ground  \nstudent_chair6 | middle | near, student_desk6 | face to, student_desk6 | ground  \nstudent_chair7 | middle | near, student_desk7 | face to, student_desk7 | ground  \nstudent_chair8 | middle | near, student_desk8 | face to, student_desk8 | ground  \nstudent_chair9 | middle | near, student_desk9 | face to, student_desk9 | ground  \nstudent_chair10 | middle | near, student_desk10 | face to, student_desk10 | ground  \nstudent_chair11 | middle | near, student_desk11 | face to, student_desk11 | ground  \nstudent_chair12 | middle | near, student_desk12 | face to, student_desk12 | ground  \nstudent_chair13 | middle | near, student_desk13 | face to, student_desk13 | ground  \nstudent_chair14 | middle | near, student_desk14 | face to, student_desk14 | ground  \nstudent_chair15 | middle | near, student_desk15 | face to, student_desk15 | ground', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_1ZuFzfrHXOkCmYIxkCSPPK6J'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_uyRLgKI7BjpVgPCnO981ppzr', 'function': {'name': 'object_placement_module', 'arguments': '{"action_plan": "1.

[2025-05-17 14:14:59,778] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher's chair behind it.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.
- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.
- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.
- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.
- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.
- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher's desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.
- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.
- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.

walking space between objects.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher\'s chair behind it.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.\n- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.\n- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.\n- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.\n- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.\n- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher\'s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.\n- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 14:16:44,346] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher's chair behind it.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.
- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.
- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.
- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.
- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.
- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher's desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.
- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.
- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.

walking space between objects.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher\'s chair behind it.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.\n- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.\n- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.\n- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.\n- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.\n- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher\'s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.\n- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 14:19:41,205] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher's chair behind it.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.
- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.
- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.
- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.
- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.
- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher's desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.
- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.
- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.

tool_call_id=\'call_yOF9Nr0vUFySpgZONXyNt2wd\'\nThis was the action plan:\n- Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher\'s chair behind it.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.\n- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.\n- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.\n- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.\n- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.\n- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher\'s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.\n- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_front\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_front\', \'issue\': \'Wall front is not flush with the floor edges.

[2025-05-17 14:22:48,243] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher's chair behind it.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.
- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.
- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.
- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.
- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.
- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher's desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.
- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.
- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.

objects.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher\'s chair behind it.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.\n- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.\n- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.\n- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.\n- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.\n- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher\'s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.\n- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 14:26:56,258] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for about 15 students with ample walking space between objects.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher's chair behind it.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.
- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.
- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.
- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.
- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.
- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher's desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.
- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.
- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.

objects.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each, each desk paired with a chair facing the front of the classroom. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with sufficient spacing.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom, facing the students. Add a comfortable teacher\'s chair behind it.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, centered behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along the left and right side walls.\n- Place a round wall clock on the right side wall near the front.\n- Add several educational posters evenly spaced on the left and back walls.\n- Create four large windows evenly spaced on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Place two large potted plants in two corners at the back of the classroom.\n- Create ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for bright artificial lighting.\n- Add two waste bins: one near the teacher\'s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a light wood tone for desks and chairs, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Set walls and floor in light shades for a bright, welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all chairs face the teacher and blackboard.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects to avoid collisions.\n- Add a wooden floor with dimensions fitting all objects and four walls enclosing the classroom.\n- Include a simple ceiling with mounted lights and the projector.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'teacher_chair1\', \'path\': \'objects.teacher_chair1\', \'issue\': \'Slight intersection with teacher_desk1: chair overlaps desk by ~0.05m in Z.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust chair back further from desk: set position to { x: 0.0, y: 0.45, z: -4.40 } (moves front of chair to z = -4.10, leaving a 0.10m gap behind desk ).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant1\', \'path\': \'objects.potted_plant1\', \'issue\': \'Overlaps with bookshelf1 in back-left corner (collision in X/Z).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move into back-left corner clearing the shelf: set position to { x: -3.80, y: 0.6, z: 4.20 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant2\', \'path\': \'objects.potted_plant2\', \'issue\': \'Overlaps with bookshelf2 in back-right corner (collision in X/Z).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move into back-right corner clearing the shelf: set position to { x: 3.80, y: 0.6, z: 4.20 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'educational_poster4\', \'path\': \'objects.educational_poster4\', \'issue\': \'Placed on right wall – action plan calls for posters on left and back walls.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition to back wall and face interior: set position to { x: -2.0, y: 1.2, z: 4.6 }, rotation to { x: 0.0, y: 180.0, z: 0.0 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'educational_poster5\', \'path\': \'objects.educational_poster5\', \'issue\': \'Placed on right wall – should be on back wall according to plan.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition to back wall and face interior: set position to { x: 0.0, y: 1.2, z: 4.6 }, rotation to { x: 0.0, y: 180.0, z: 0.0 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'educational_poster6\', \'path\': \'objects.educational_poster6\', \'issue\': \'Placed on right wall – should be on back wall according to plan.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reposition to back wall and face interior: set position to { x: 2.0, y: 1.2, z: 4.6 }, rotation to { x: 0.0, y: 180.0, z: 0.0 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'blackboard1\', \'path\': \'objects.blackboard1\', \'issue\': \'Floating ~0.125m in front of the wall – not flush against front wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Push board into wall: set position to { x: 0.0, y: 1.5, z: -4.475 } (half of board depth).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'projector1\', \'path\': \'objects.projector1\', \'issue\': \'Not centered on blackboard – Z coordinate is offset by ~0.175m.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Align projector with board center: set position to { x: 0.0, y: 2.9, z: -4.375 }.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window1\', \'path\': \'objects.window1\', \'issue\': \'Window is floating 0.1m from back wall interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Flush to wall: set position.z to 4.5 (new position { x: -2.4, y: 1.6, z: 4.5 }).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window2\', \'path\': \'objects.window2\', \'issue\': \'Window is floating 0.1m from back wall interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Flush to wall: set position.z to 4.5 (new position { x: -0.8, y: 1.6, z: 4.5 }).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window3\', \'path\': \'objects.window3\', \'issue\': \'Window is floating 0.1m from back wall interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Flush to wall: set position.z to 4.5 (new position { x: 0.8, y: 1.6, z: 4.5 }).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window4\', \'path\': \'objects.window4\', \'issue\': \'Window is floating 0.1m from back wall interior.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Flush to wall: set position.z to 4.5 (new position { x: 2.4, y: 1.6, z: 4.5 }).\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

Write multiple long sentences, that will be forwarded to an \'3D Object Generator\'. The\n3D Object Generator will receive the specification field and creates a 3D Asset with your specification. Be as detailed as possible\nfor the specification. Use the styles as described in the action plan!\n- Create the same specification for the same types of items. For example: all student chairs are the same.\n- Dont write any coordinates or relations into the specification, only a visual description of the object should be in the specification!\n- Only use the valid json schema, see Examples.
