The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

[2025-05-17 15:53:41,565] INFO: Result:  High-level design strategy:
We begin by defining the classroom envelope—establishing the floor, walls, and ceiling—then evenly distribute ceiling lights for uniform illumination. The teacher’s desk is centered along the front wall with the chair placed behind, facing it. Student desks are arranged in three rows of five, each paired with a chair positioned nearby and facing the desk. A whiteboard is mounted above the teacher’s desk on the front wall. A bookshelf is placed in the back-right corner, and a window with curtains is centered on the left wall. A clock and three posters are spaced along the back wall; additional posters line the side walls. Finally, waste bins and a potted plant occupy the front and back corners. Constraints ensure proper facing directions, clear aisles, and correct height placements.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

[2025-05-17 16:03:55,469] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.
- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a teacher's chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.
- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.
- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.
- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.
- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.
- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.
- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.
- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.
- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.
- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.
- Color the student desks and teacher's desk in complementary wood tones.
- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher's chair in a darker complementary tone.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.
- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

movement and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:08:09,635] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.
- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a teacher's chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.
- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.
- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.
- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.
- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.
- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.
- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.
- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.
- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.
- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.
- Color the student desks and teacher's desk in complementary wood tones.
- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher's chair in a darker complementary tone.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.
- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

movement and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'floor\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/floor\', \'issue\': \'Floor pivot at y=0.0 causes

[2025-05-17 16:10:48,807] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.
- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a teacher's chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.
- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.
- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.
- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.
- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.
- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.
- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.
- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.
- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.
- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.
- Color the student desks and teacher's desk in complementary wood tones.
- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher's chair in a darker complementary tone.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.
- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:12:30,255] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.
- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a teacher's chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.
- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.
- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.
- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.
- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.
- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.
- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.
- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.
- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.
- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.
- Color the student desks and teacher's desk in complementary wood tones.
- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher's chair in a darker complementary tone.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.
- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.
- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a teacher's chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.
- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.
- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.
- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.
- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.
- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.
- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.
- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.
- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.
- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.
- Color the student desks and teacher's desk in complementary wood tones.
- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher's chair in a darker complementary tone.
- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.
- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.

overall classroom size suitable for a medium group of about 15-20 people with ample space for movement and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor, walls, or ceiling as appropriate.\n\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_front\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_front\', \'issue\': \'Wall bottom is embedded into the floor (bottom at y=0.05 overlapping floor thickness) and top extends 0.05 units above the ceiling (top at y=3.25 vs ceiling at y=3.2).

Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, all placed on the floor with clear spacing between desks.\n- Design the student chairs so they face towards the front wall.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and facing the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a teacher\'s chair behind the teacher desk, facing the students.\n- Mount a large rectangular whiteboard centrally on the front wall, above and behind the teacher desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books on the right side wall, positioned close to the back corner.\n- Install a large window with curtains on the left side wall to let in natural light.\n- Place a circular wall clock on the back wall, centered above eye level.\n- Create multiple ceiling lights spaced evenly across the classroom ceiling to provide ample illumination.\n- Add educational posters or charts evenly spaced along the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back corner near the bookshelf.\n- Include a potted plant in the front left corner of the classroom to add greenery.\n- Create a tile floor covering the entire classroom area.\n- Construct four walls around the classroom, each wall touching the floor.\n- Create a ceiling covering the classroom with lights attached.\n- Color the student desks and teacher\'s desk in complementary wood tones.\n- Color the student chairs in a bright color for vibrancy, and the teacher\'s chair in a darker complementary tone.\n- Use light neutral colors for walls and ceiling for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all furniture and objects do not collide, with adequate walking spaces between desks, chairs, the teacher desk, and other objects.\n- Place all objects properly on the floor,
