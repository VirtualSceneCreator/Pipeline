The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

Curtains match the window height (1.6 × 1.5 × 0.05 m). Storage and décor share slim depths (bookshelf 1 × 2 × 0.3 m, posters/charts 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.01 m and 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.01 m respectively). Student desks and chairs use standard footprints (1.2 × 0.6 × 0.75 m and 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.9 m).

The teacher’s desk and chair occupy the front center, facing the class, with the whiteboard centered on the front wall above. Student desks form three rows of five, evenly spaced with 1 m side aisles and 1.5 m between rows; chairs sit 0.55 m behind each desk, all facing the front. Storage and décor (bookshelf, window, curtains) are flush to the side walls; posters, chart, and clock are placed on the left, back, and right walls at specified heights; a potted plant and bins occupy corners and near the teacher zone. Six ceiling fixtures fly near the ceiling in two columns at X=±1.5 m above the teacher area and first two desk rows (Z=+3, +1, ‑1) for even illumination and clear walkways. Materials and orientations follow the specified palette and directions.

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

Perimeter walls follow the room dimensions: two long walls at 10 m, two short at 8 m, all 3 m tall and 0.2 m thick. Large fixed elements—teacher’s desk (2 × 0.8 × 0.75 m), teacher’s chair (0.6 × 0.6 × 0.9 m), whiteboard (3 × 1.5 × 0.1 m), window (1.5 × 1.5 × 0.1 m)—are sized first. Curtains match the window height (1.6 × 1.5 × 0.05 m). Storage and décor share slim depths (bookshelf 1 × 2 × 0.3 m, posters/charts 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.01 m and 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.01 m respectively). Student desks and chairs use standard footprints (1.2 × 0.6 × 0.75 m and 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.9 m). Accessories (clock 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 m, plant 0.5 × 1 × 0.5 m, bin 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.3 m) and ceiling lights (0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 m) remain unobtrusive.

[2025-05-17 16:01:45,638] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size to comfortably fit 15 students with enough space for aisles and walking.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.
- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.
- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.
- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.
- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.
- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.
- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.
- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.\n- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.\n- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.\n- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.\n- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.\n- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:05:29,125] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size to comfortably fit 15 students with enough space for aisles and walking.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.
- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.
- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.
- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.
- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.
- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.
- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.
- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.\n- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.\n- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.\n- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.\n- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.\n- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'floor_plane\', \'path\': \'Compact_Classroom_For_15_Students/floor_plane\', \'issue\': \'The floor plane is centered at y=0 with a thickness of 0.1.

[2025-05-17 16:09:57,505] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size to comfortably fit 15 students with enough space for aisles and walking.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.
- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.
- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.
- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.
- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.
- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.
- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.
- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.\n- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.\n- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.\n- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.\n- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.\n- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:10:39,922] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine the overall classroom size to comfortably fit 15 students with enough space for aisles and walking.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.
- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.
- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.
- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.
- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.
- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.
- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.
- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.

tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.\n- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.\n- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.\n- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.\n- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.\n- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.
- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.
- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.
- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.
- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.
- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.
- Include waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.
- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.
- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.

Determine the overall classroom size to comfortably fit 15 students with enough space for aisles and walking.\n- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with space between each.\n- Each student desk will have a chair facing the front of the classroom.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the classroom with a comfortable chair facing the student desks. Place it on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create four walls enclosing the classroom, with smooth corners and a door on one side wall.\n- Create a floor matching the size to fit all objects comfortably with no collisions.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly distributed for ample lighting.\n- Include a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Put educational posters and charts spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add a large window with curtains on the opposite side wall from the bookshelf.\n- Place a wall clock on a side wall visible to everyone.\n- Add a potted plant in a corner to add greenery.\n- Include waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Use a warm wood tone for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for the chairs.\n- Color the walls in a light neutral color and the floor in a slightly darker hue for contrast.\n- Ensure all chairs face the front, teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and no collisions among any objects.\n- Position all objects properly on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'door_right\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/door_right\', \'issue\': \'Door panel intersects wall thickness and is oriented outward (front side facing away from interior).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to 3.775 (flush with wall interior: front wall center 3.9 minus half wall thickness 0.1 and half door depth 0.025) and update rotation.y to 270 (face interior).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'whiteboard\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/whiteboard\', \'issue\': \'Whiteboard is centered at z=3.9 and intersects the front wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to 3.775 (front wall at 3.9 minus half wall thickness 0.1 and half whiteboard depth 0.025) to flush the board on the inside face of the wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'poster-2\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/poster-2\', \'issue\': \'Poster is centered at z=-3.9 and intersects the back wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -3.775 (back wall at -3.9 plus half wall thickness 0.1 and half poster depth 0.01) to flush it on the inside face.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'poster-3\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/poster-3\', \'issue\': \'Poster is centered at z=-3.9 and intersects the back wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -3.775 (back wall at -3.9 plus half wall thickness 0.1 and half poster depth 0.01) to flush it on the inside face.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'chart_board\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/chart_board\', \'issue\': \'Chart board is centered at z=-3.9 and intersects the back wall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -3.775 (back wall at -3.9 plus half wall thickness 0.1 and half chart depth 0.015) to flush it on the inside face.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'window_left\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/window_left\', \'issue\': \'Window on left wall is rotated y=270 and its front face is pointing outward instead of into the classroom.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Update rotation.y to 90, so the window faces the interior of the room (eastward).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'curtain_panels\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/curtain_panels\', \'issue\': \'Curtain panels are rotated y=270 and face outward instead of into the classroom.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Update rotation.y to 90 to match the window and face the interior of the room.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'poster-0\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/poster-0\', \'issue\': \'Left-wall poster is rotated y=270 and faces outside rather than into the room.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Update rotation.y to 90 so the poster faces inward.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'poster-1\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/poster-1\', \'issue\': \'Left-wall poster is rotated y=270 and faces outside rather than into the room.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Update rotation.y to 90 so the poster faces inward.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'Bookshelf on right wall partly intersects wall thickness and is oriented incorrectly (front facing wall).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to 3.6 (front wall interior face at 3.8 minus half depth 0.2) and update rotation.y to 270 so shelves face into the room.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'clock\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/clock\', \'issue\': \'Clock is mounted on right wall with rotation.y=0 (facing forward) and protrudes outside the wall plane.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Update rotation.y to 270 so it faces into the room and set position.x to 3.775 (flush with interior face of right wall: 3.9 minus half wall thickness 0.1 and half clock depth 0.05).\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

You receive a json. And your task is to convert the json into the defined json\nformat, see \' Json schema \'.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- Keep all the elements in the json. The values must stay the same! For example position, rotation, dimensions ... MUST stay the same!\n- Try to create objectGroups, to group the objects in the json.\n- Fill the specification field. Write multiple long sentences, that will be forwarded to an \'3D Object Generator\'. The\n3D Object Generator will receive the specification field and creates a 3D Asset with your specification.
