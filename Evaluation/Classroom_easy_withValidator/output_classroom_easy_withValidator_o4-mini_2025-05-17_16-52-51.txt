The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

The teacher’s desk (1.6×0.75×0.8 m) sits centered at the front with a matching chair, and a 4×1.5 m blackboard above. Two 1.5×1.5 m windows with curtains flank the back wall. Four 0.8×2×0.3 m bookshelves line the sides. Six 0.3×0.1×0.3 m ceiling lights in a 2×3 grid will provide bright illumination. Two 0.4×1×0.4 m potted plants go in opposite corners, two 0.3×0.4×0.3 m waste bins at the teacher’s desk and back, a 0.5 m diameter clock, a 0.4×0.1×0.3 m projector, and ten 0.6×0.8×0.01 m educational posters on side and back walls. A 1×2.1×0.05 m door is cut into one side wall. All seating faces the front.

Height constraint:\n    6.1) ground: on the ground\n    6.2) top: touching the ceiling\n    6.3) air: between the ceiling and the ground\n\nFor each object, you must have one global constraint and you can select various numbers of constraints and any\ncombinations of them and the output format must be: object | global constraint | constraint 1 | constraint 2 | ...\nFor example: sofa-0 | edge\ncoffee table-0 | middle | near, sofa-0 | in front of, sofa-0 | center aligned, sofa-0 | face to, sofa-0\ntv stand-0 | edge | far, coffee table-0 | in front of, coffee table-0 | center aligned, coffee table-0 | face to,\ncoffee table-0\nflying car-0 | middle| far, coffee table-0 | flying top air\n\nHere are some guidelines for you:\n1. I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5. There are usually no objects on top of the walls. With "one a wall" is usually meant -> on the side of a wall.\n6. Chairs must be placed near to the table/desk and face to the table/desk.\n\nPlease keep going until the users query is completely resolved, before ending your turn.\n    '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nHere are the objects that I want to place: ['floor', 'front_wall', 'back_wall', 'left_wall', 'right_wall', 'door', 'window1', 'window2', 'curtain1', 'curtain2', 'blackboard', 'projector', 'teacher_desk', 'teacher_chair', 'bookshelf1', 'bookshelf2', 'bookshelf3', 'bookshelf4', 'student_desk1', 'student_desk2', 'student_desk3', 'student_desk4', 'student_desk5', 'student_desk6', 'student_desk7', 'student_desk8', 'student_desk9', 'student_desk10', 'student_desk11', 'student_desk12', 'student_desk13', 'student_desk14', 'student_desk15', 'student_desk16', 'student_chair1', 'student_chair2', 'student_chair3', 'student_chair4', 'student_chair5', 'student_chair6', 'student_chair7', 'student_chair8', 'student_chair9', 'student_chair10', 'student_chair11', 'student_chair12', 'student_chair13', 'student_chair14', 'student_chair15', 'student_chair16', 'ceiling_light1', 'ceiling_light2', 'ceiling_light3', 'ceiling_light4', 'ceiling_light5', 'ceiling_light6', 'educational_poster1', 'educational_poster2', 'educational_poster3', 'educational_poster4', 'educational_poster5', 'educational_poster6', 'educational_poster7', 'educational_poster8', 'educational_poster9', 'educational_poster10', 'clock', 'potted_plant1', 'potted_plant2', 'waste_bin1', 'waste_bin2']\nHere are the relations that I want to create: - Floor at y=0.\n- Walls around edges of floor: front, back, left, right.\n- Door in right wall centered at x=2, spanning y from 0 to 2.1.\n- Windows on back wall: window1 at left back, window2 at right back, with curtains.\n- Blackboard mounted on front wall above teacher's desk at y=1.6.\n- Teacher's desk centered 0.5 m from front wall with chair behind.\n- Projector on ceiling centered aligned with blackboard.\n- Bookshelves placed against left and right walls: two on each side evenly spaced.\n- Student desks in 4 rows facing front: row1 closest to front at z=1.5, then rows at 3.1, 4.7, 6.3.

[2025-05-17 16:26:36,736] INFO: Result:  In this design, I started with the floor and surrounding walls as foundational anchors. Next, I placed fixed architectural elements—door, windows with curtains, and the blackboard—mounted squarely on their respective walls using clear edge and alignment constraints. The teacher’s desk and chair are positioned centrally near the front wall, with the overhead projector ceiling-mounted in alignment with the blackboard. Bookshelves flank the side walls, while student desks and chairs form a front-facing grid in the room’s core, defined through near/far constraints for precise row and column spacing. Ceiling lights are evenly distributed on the ceiling, and educational posters plus the clock are mounted on the walls at appropriate heights. Finally, potted plants occupy room corners and waste bins are placed near the teacher area and back center. Throughout, global constraints locate items at edges or center, position and distance constraints govern spacing, alignment constraints ensure centering, and height constraints secure correct mounting or floor placement.

Next, I placed fixed architectural elements—door, windows with curtains, and the blackboard—mounted squarely on their respective walls using clear edge and alignment constraints. The teacher’s desk and chair are positioned centrally near the front wall, with the overhead projector ceiling-mounted in alignment with the blackboard. Bookshelves flank the side walls, while student desks and chairs form a front-facing grid in the room’s core, defined through near/far constraints for precise row and column spacing. Ceiling lights are evenly distributed on the ceiling, and educational posters plus the clock are mounted on the walls at appropriate heights. Finally, potted plants occupy room corners and waste bins are placed near the teacher area and back center. Throughout, global constraints locate items at edges or center, position and distance constraints govern spacing, alignment constraints ensure centering, and height constraints secure correct mounting

This yields roughly 6.2×8 m of classroom footprint. Rounding up for margin gives a 7×8 m floor. Walls will be 3 m high and 0.1 m thick. The teacher’s desk (1.6×0.75×0.8 m) sits centered at the front with a matching chair, and a 4×1.5 m blackboard above. Two 1.5×1.5 m windows with curtains flank the back wall. Four 0.8×2×0.3 m bookshelves line the sides. Six 0.3×0.1×0.3 m ceiling lights in a 2×3 grid will provide bright illumination. Two 0.4×1×0.4 m potted plants go in opposite corners, two 0.3×0.4×0.3 m waste bins at the teacher’s desk and back, a 0.5 m diameter clock, a 0.4×0.1×0.3 m projector, and ten 0.6×0.8×0.01 m educational posters on side and back walls.

Next, I placed fixed architectural elements—door, windows with curtains, and the blackboard—mounted squarely on their respective walls using clear edge and alignment constraints. The teacher’s desk and chair are positioned centrally near the front wall, with the overhead projector ceiling-mounted in alignment with the blackboard. Bookshelves flank the side walls, while student desks and chairs form a front-facing grid in the room’s core, defined through near/far constraints for precise row and column spacing. Ceiling lights are evenly distributed on the ceiling, and educational posters plus the clock are mounted on the walls at appropriate heights. Finally, potted plants occupy room corners and waste bins are placed near the teacher area and back center. Throughout, global constraints locate items at edges or center, position and distance constraints govern spacing, alignment constraints ensure centering, and height constraints secure correct mounting

Next, I placed fixed architectural elements—door, windows with curtains, and the blackboard—mounted squarely on their respective walls using clear edge and alignment constraints. The teacher’s desk and chair are positioned centrally near the front wall, with the overhead projector ceiling-mounted in alignment with the blackboard. Bookshelves flank the side walls, while student desks and chairs form a front-facing grid in the room’s core, defined through near/far constraints for precise row and column spacing. Ceiling lights are evenly distributed on the ceiling, and educational posters plus the clock are mounted on the walls at appropriate heights. Finally, potted plants occupy room corners and waste bins are placed near the teacher area and back center. Throughout, global constraints locate items at edges or center, position and distance constraints govern spacing, alignment constraints ensure centering, and height constraints secure correct mounting

[2025-05-17 16:40:13,407] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.
- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.
- Add a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.
- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.
- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.
- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.
- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.
- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.
- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher's desk are located.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.
- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher's desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.
- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.

aisles.\n- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.\n- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.\n- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.\n- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.\n- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.\n- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.\n- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher\'s desk are located.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.\n- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher\'s desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.\n- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:43:13,425] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.
- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.
- Add a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.
- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.
- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.
- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.
- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.
- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.
- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher's desk are located.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.
- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher's desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.
- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.

a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.\n- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.\n- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.\n- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.\n- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.\n- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.\n- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.\n- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher\'s desk are located.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.\n- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher\'s desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.\n- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.\n[Conversation finished]These

[2025-05-17 16:46:53,004] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.
- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.
- Add a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.
- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.
- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.
- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.
- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.
- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.
- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher's desk are located.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.
- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher's desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.
- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.

`position.z` adjusted from 3.90 → 3.95  \n- **curtain1 / curtain2**: `position.z` adjusted from 3.75 → 3.80  \n- **educational_poster1–5**: `position.x` shifted from -3.445 → -3.395  \n- **educational_poster6–10**: `position.x` shifted from  3.445 →  3.395  \n- **clock**: `position.x` shifted from -3.445 → -3.15  \n\nAll other objects have been kept exactly as in the original scene.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.\n- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.\n- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.\n- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.\n- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.\n- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.\n- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.\n- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher\'s desk are located.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.\n- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher\'s desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.\n- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:49:38,783] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.
- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.
- Add a large teacher's desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.
- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.
- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.
- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.
- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.
- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.
- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.
- Place waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.
- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.
- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.
- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher's desk are located.
- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.
- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher's desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.
- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.

`position.z` adjusted from 3.90 → 3.95  \n- **curtain1 / curtain2**: `position.z` adjusted from 3.75 → 3.80  \n- **educational_poster1–5**: `position.x` shifted from -3.445 → -3.395  \n- **educational_poster6–10**: `position.x` shifted from  3.445 →  3.395  \n- **clock**: `position.x` shifted from -3.445 → -3.15  \n\nAll other objects have been kept exactly as in the original scene.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Determine a room size suitable for a classroom with about 16 students, allowing comfortable spacing between seats and aisles.\n- Create 16 student desks arranged in 4 rows of 4 desks each. Each desk is a rectangular table with a chair facing forward. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between them to allow movement.\n- Add a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered, with an adjustable chair behind it facing the student desks.\n- Place a large rectangular blackboard or whiteboard on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Include a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard.\n- Add two tall bookshelves filled with books along each of the side walls.\n- Place a circular wall clock high on one side wall.\n- Add two potted plants in opposite corners to bring a touch of greenery.\n- Install multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced to illuminate the room brightly.\n- Attach educational posters or charts spaced evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Place waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Incorporate large windows with curtains on the back wall to allow natural light.\n- Create a smooth floor that fits all objects appropriately.\n- Build four walls around the classroom with a door on one side wall.\n- Ensure all seating faces the front wall where the blackboard and teacher\'s desk are located.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks, chairs, and other furniture with no collisions.\n- Color student desks in light wood tone, teacher\'s desk and bookshelves in darker wood tones, chairs in a complementary neutral color.\n- Paint walls in a light pastel shade to create a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on appropriate walls/ceiling.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'potted_plant1\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/potted_plant1\', \'issue\': \'Colliding with bookshelf1 due to overlapping extents\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to { x: -3.20, y: 0.60, z: -3.75 } to place it flush in the front-left corner, clearing the bookshelf area\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant2\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/potted_plant2\', \'issue\': \'Colliding with bookshelf4 due to overlapping extents\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to { x: 3.20, y: 0.60, z: 3.75 } to place it flush in the back-right corner, clearing the bookshelf area\'}, {\'objectName\': \'projector\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/projector\', \'issue\': \'Not aligned with the blackboard center, may cause skewed projection\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.z to -3.875 (align with blackboard) while keeping x: 0.0 and y: 2.90\'}, {\'objectName\': \'back_wall\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/back_wall\', \'issue\': \'No educational posters found on the back wall\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Add posters evenly spaced along the back wall—for example, create poster objects at positions { x: -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0; y: 1.5; z: 3.395 }, rotation (0,0,0), dimensions (0.6,0.8,0.01)\'}, {\'objectName\': \'environment\', \'path\': \'scene/environment\', \'issue\': \'No ceiling light fixtures present as scene objects\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Add multiple ceiling light fixtures (e.g. point or spotlights) at positions { x: ±2.5, y: 2.8, z: ±1.0 } to evenly illuminate the room\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}
