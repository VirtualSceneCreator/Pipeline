The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

Twenty student desks in four rows of five occupy the front half, each with a chair behind it; all desks face the front wall and maintain 1 m aisles. The whiteboard is wall-mounted above the teacher’s desk, with the projector hanging 0.2 m below the ceiling aligned to it. A bookshelf sits flush in the back-left corner on the left wall; a window with curtain is between the bookshelf and front wall. Posters are evenly spaced on the back wall (4) and left wall (2).

- Determine the overall classroom size suitable to comfortably accommodate 20 students and 4 walls with no ceiling.
- Create 4 walls defining the classroom room perimeter.
- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables, each with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with enough space to walk between them.
- Create a large teacher's desk and chair at the front of the classroom, centered and facing the student desks.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard mounted on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard to simulate a teaching setup.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a large circular wall clock on a visible side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add a touch of nature.
- Design multiple ceiling lights suspended appropriately, despite absence of a ceiling, fix them slightly above the top of walls.
- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on side and back walls.
- Add two waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Include two large windows with curtains on one side wall.
- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.
- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.
- Create a floor large enough to fit all objects comfortably.
- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls as appropriate.
- Add two ceiling fans suspended just above the wall height for comfort.
- Place a few motivational quote boards in the room for inspiration.
- Ensure all objects have enough space for walking and no collisions.

Chairs align in scale to fit comfortably under and behind their desks. The teacher’s desk and chair are proportionally larger for emphasis. Wall-mounted elements like the whiteboard and clock span logical widths on the front and side walls without overwhelming the students’ view. The projector and ceiling lights have small, low-profile dimensions to avoid visual clutter. The bookshelf matches the height of a standard classroom ceiling minus clearance, and decorative elements (posters, window curtains, potted plants) are sized to maintain harmony on their respective walls.

The teacher’s desk and chair go at the center front, 1.5 m from the front wall, both on the ground and facing the students. Twenty student desks in four rows of five occupy the front half, each with a chair behind it; all desks face the front wall and maintain 1 m aisles. The whiteboard is wall-mounted above the teacher’s desk, with the projector hanging 0.2 m below the ceiling aligned to it. A bookshelf sits flush in the back-left corner on the left wall; a window with curtain is between the bookshelf and front wall. Posters are evenly spaced on the back wall (4) and left wall (2). A wall clock centers on the right wall. A potted plant occupies the back-right corner. Two waste bins go beside the teacher’s desk and in the back-left corner. Six ceiling lights hang in two rows of three, 0.2 m below the ceiling.

[2025-05-17 16:29:26,969] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriately sized rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.
- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.
- Place a large teacher's desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.
- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.
- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.

rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.\n- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.

rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.\n- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:32:19,989] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriately sized rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.
- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.
- Place a large teacher's desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.
- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.
- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.

rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.\n- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_left\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_left\', \'issue\': \'Left wall position is inconsistent with front and back walls, misaligned by wall thickness causing room width mismatch.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to -3.75 (instead of -3.85) to align interior surface flush with floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_right\', \'path\': \'scene.objects.wall_right\', \'issue\': \'Right wall position is inconsistent with front and back walls, misaligned by wall thickness causing room width mismatch.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.x to 3.75 (instead of 3.85) to align interior surface flush with floor edge.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'teacher_desk\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/teacher_desk\', \'issue\': \'Bottom of the desk sinks 5cm below the floor top (floor top at y=0.05, desk bottom at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.y = 0.425 (raise by +0.05).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'teacher_chair\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/teacher_chair\', \'issue\': \'Bottom of the chair sinks 5cm below the floor top (floor top at y=0.05, chair bottom at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.y = 0.60 (raise by +0.05).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student_desk1-20\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/student_desk*\', \'issue\': \'All student desks sink 5cm below the floor top (floor top at y=0.05, desk bottoms at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set each desk position.y = 0.425 (raise by +0.05).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'student_chair1-20\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/student_chair*\', \'issue\': \'All student chairs sink 5cm below the floor top (floor top at y=0.05, chair bottoms at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set each chair position.y = 0.55 (raise by +0.05).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'waste_bin1 & waste_bin2\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/waste_bin1, waste_bin2\', \'issue\': \'Waste bins sink 5cm below the floor top (floor top at y=0.05, bin bottoms at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.y = 0.30 for both bins (raise by +0.05).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'waste_bin1\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/waste_bin1\', \'issue\': "Overlaps with the teacher\'s desk volume (currently inside desk footprint).", \'suggestedFix\': \'Move to position.x = 1.2, position.y = 0.30, position.z = -3.25 (places the bin just outside the right side of the desk).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'bookshelf\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'Sinks 5cm into the floor and sits ~0.125m away from the back wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.y = 1.15 (raise by +0.05) and position.z = 4.875 (flush to back wall).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'potted_plant\', \'path\': \'Small_Classroom_For_20_Students/objects/potted_plant\', \'issue\': \'Sinks 5cm into the floor (floor top at y=0.05, plant base at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set position.y = 0.65 (raise by +0.05).\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:35:53,354] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriately sized rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.
- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.
- Place a large teacher's desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.
- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.
- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.

student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:37:14,534] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriately sized rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.
- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.
- Place a large teacher's desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.
- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.
- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.

student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:40:59,312] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriately sized rectangular room for a classroom with four walls and a floor, ensuring enough walking space between objects.
- Create 20 student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.
- Place a large teacher's desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.
- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.
- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.
- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.
- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.
- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.
- Position waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom.
- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.
- Color the teacher's desk in a darker wood tone.
- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.
- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.

student desks, each paired with a chair, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. All desks and chairs are placed on the floor with ample space to walk between them. Ensure each chair faces its desk.\n- Place a large teacher\'s desk with a chair at the front center of the classroom, facing the student desks, located on the floor.\n- Attach a large rectangular whiteboard on the front wall above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Install a ceiling-mounted projector aligned centrally with the whiteboard.\n- Create a tall wooden bookshelf along one side wall, filled with colored books.\n- Add a circular wall clock centrally placed on one side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the classroom to add a touch of greenery.\n- Arrange evenly spaced ceiling lights across the ceiling for bright illumination.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly on the side and back walls.\n- Position waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Add a large window with curtains on one side wall to let in natural light.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone and chairs in a complementary color.\n- Color the teacher\'s desk in a darker wood tone.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and the floor to maintain a bright atmosphere.\n- Ensure sufficient walking space exists between all desks, chairs, and other objects.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted onto walls or ceiling without any collisions.\n\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'wall_front\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_front\', \'issue\': \'The bottom of the wall intersects the floor by 0.05 units (floor top is at y=0.05, wall bottom is at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.y from 1.5 to 1.55 so the wall bottom aligns exactly with the top surface of the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_back\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_back\', \'issue\': \'The bottom of the wall intersects the floor by 0.05 units (floor top is at y=0.05, wall bottom is at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.y from 1.5 to 1.55 so the wall bottom aligns exactly with the top surface of the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_left\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_left\', \'issue\': \'The bottom of the wall intersects the floor by 0.05 units (floor top is at y=0.05, wall bottom is at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.y from 1.5 to 1.55 so the wall bottom aligns exactly with the top surface of the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_right\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/wall_right\', \'issue\': \'The bottom of the wall intersects the floor by 0.05 units (floor top is at y=0.05, wall bottom is at y=0.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Adjust position.y from 1.5 to 1.55 so the wall bottom aligns exactly with the top surface of the floor.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Left-most student desks and chairs (student_desk1, student_chair1, student_desk6, student_chair6, student_desk11, student_chair11, student_desk16, student_chair16)\', \'path\': \'scene.objects\', \'issue\': \'These desks and chairs at x = -3.8 extend beyond the floor boundary (floor extents x ∈ [-3.8,3.8]).
