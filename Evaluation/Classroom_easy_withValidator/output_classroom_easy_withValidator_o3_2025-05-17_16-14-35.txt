The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

I arrange student desks in a 5×4 grid in the middle of the room, align chairs behind each desk facing the desk direction (+z), position the teacher’s desk at the front-center with the chair behind it facing the desk, mount the blackboard on the front wall, place the bookshelf against the left wall, and hang the clock on the right wall. I add windows on the back wall with curtains in front, evenly space ceiling lights along the room’s length, set potted plants in two corners, and put the waste bin near the teacher’s desk. All furniture rests on the ground except for the hanging lights and wall-mounted blackboard.

[2025-05-17 15:57:29,501] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.
- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.
- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.
- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.
- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.
- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.
- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.
- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.
- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.\n- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.\n- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.\n- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.\n- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.\n- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.\n- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.\n- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.\n- Add a waste bin near the teacher\'s desk on the floor.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.\n- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs':

[2025-05-17 15:58:58,981] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.
- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.
- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.
- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.
- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.
- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.
- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.
- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.
- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.\n- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.\n- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.\n- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.\n- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.\n- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.\n- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.\n- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.\n- Add a waste bin near the teacher\'s desk on the floor.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.\n- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs':

[2025-05-17 16:01:30,315] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.
- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.
- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.
- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.
- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.
- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.
- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.
- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.
- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.\n- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.\n- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.\n- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.\n- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.\n- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.\n- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.\n- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.\n- Add a waste bin near the teacher\'s desk on the floor.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.\n- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and

[2025-05-17 16:05:25,162] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.
- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.
- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.
- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.
- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.
- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.
- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.
- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.
- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

height. Other items remain unchanged.\nThis was the action plan:\n- Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.\n- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.\n- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.\n- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.\n- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.\n- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.\n- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.\n- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.\n- Add a waste bin near the teacher\'s desk on the floor.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.\n- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:09:25,455] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an appropriate overall classroom size to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.
- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.
- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.
- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.
- Create a large teacher's desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.
- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher's desk.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.
- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.
- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.
- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.
- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.
- Add a waste bin near the teacher's desk on the floor.
- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher's desk and chair face the students.
- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher's desk, and complementary colors for chairs.
- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.
- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.
- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.

to comfortably fit furniture and allow walking space, approximately for 20 students.\n- Create a rectangular floor as the classroom base.\n- Construct four walls around the floor to enclose the classroom fully.\n- Place 20 student desks arranged in 5 rows with 4 desks each, spaced evenly with chairs positioned behind each desk facing forward.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front center of the room with an ergonomic chair behind it, all positioned on the floor.\n- Mount a large blackboard or whiteboard centered on the front wall above the teacher\'s desk.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books placed against one side wall.\n- Install multiple rectangular ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for illumination.\n- Include a wall clock placed on a side wall visible to all students.\n- Create two large windows with curtains on one of the long walls for natural lighting.\n- Place two potted plants in opposite corners of the room for a welcoming atmosphere.\n- Add a waste bin near the teacher\'s desk on the floor.\n- Ensure all student chairs face the front wall and the teacher\'s desk and chair face the students.\n- Use light wood texture for the student desks, a darker wood tone for the teacher\'s desk, and complementary colors for chairs.\n- Paint walls in a light neutral color and the floor a slightly darker tone to define the space and brighten the room.\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between all objects with no collisions.\n- Position all furniture on the floor except lights on the ceiling and blackboard on the wall.\n[Conversation finished]\nPut this scene into the json format: ```json\n{\n  "scene": {\n    "sceneName": "Classroom_20_Students_v2",\n    "environment": {\n      "type": "indoor",\n
