The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5.

Student desks follow in three rows of five with 2 m row spacing and 2 m column spacing, each chair 0.2 m behind its desk facing it. On the right wall is the bookshelf; a clock and potted plant go on the left. Ceiling lights go in a 2×3 grid overhead. Posters are evenly spaced on the left and back walls. Waste bins are placed near the teacher’s desk and at the back. Finally, a window with curtains sits on the left wall – all aisles remain clear and collision-free.

[2025-05-17 16:31:39,485] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.
- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.
- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.
- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.

suitable for around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.\n- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:33:39,613] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.
- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.
- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.
- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.

enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.\n- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'student_chair_1\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/student_chair_1\', \'issue\': \'This chair is

[2025-05-17 16:36:26,863] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.
- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.
- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.
- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.

around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.\n- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.\n- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 16:44:47,237] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine an overall classroom size suitable for around 15 students, providing enough space between desks and aisles.
- Create 15 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.
- Create a larger teacher's desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.
- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.
- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.
- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.
- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.
- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.
- Add waste bins near the teacher's desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.
- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.
- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.
- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.
- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher's desk.
- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.
- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.
- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.

rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks each. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks and aisles.\n- Create a larger teacher\'s desk at the front and center of the classroom, positioned to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects appropriately on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as required.\n- Ensure there is ample walking space between desks, chairs, and other objects with no collisions.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'floor\', \'path\': \'scene > objects > floor\', \'issue\': \'Floor pivot at y=0.0 causes the floor top surface to be at y=+0.05, overlapping the bottom of the walls which start at y=0.0.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set floor position.y to -0.05 so that floor top aligns exactly at y=0.0 (no overlap with walls).\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_front\', \'path\': \'scene > objects > wall_front\', \'issue\': \'Front wall pivot at z=4.0 places half of its 0.2 thickness (0.1) outside the intended interior (z > 4.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set wall_front position.z to 3.9 so that its front face sits flush at z=4.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_back\', \'path\': \'scene > objects > wall_back\', \'issue\': \'Back wall pivot at z=-4.0 places half of its 0.2 thickness outside the intended interior (z < -4.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set wall_back position.z to -3.9 so that its back face sits flush at z=-4.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_left\', \'path\': \'scene > objects > wall_left\', \'issue\': \'Left wall pivot at x=-6.0 places half of its 0.2 thickness outside the intended interior (x < -6.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set wall_left position.x to -5.9 so that its left face sits flush at x=-6.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'wall_right\', \'path\': \'scene > objects > wall_right\', \'issue\': \'Right wall pivot at x=6.0 places half of its 0.2 thickness outside the intended interior (x > 6.0).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set wall_right position.x to 5.9 so that its right face sits flush at x=6.0.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'teacher_desk\', \'path\': \'scene/objects/teacher_desk\', \'issue\': \'The desk is both sunk into the floor (y = 0) and its front is facing the wall rather than the students.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set its y position to half its height (0.8/2 = 0.4) and rotate it 180° around Y so the front faces the students.

placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, mounted above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall near the front.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner to add natural decor.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the ceiling for uniform lighting.\n- Put educational posters and charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom for convenience.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall to allow natural light.\n- Create four walls surrounding the classroom, and a floor sized correctly to fit all objects inside.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color palette.\n- Use white or light pastel colors for walls and the floor for a bright and welcoming atmosphere.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and the teacher\'s desk.\n- Make sure the teacher
