The plan will then be forwarded to a GPT called " ObjectPlacer " who ist excellent at\nfirst creating sizes for the objects, then creating relations between the objects and the placing the objects.\n\nEach module will execute each step of your plan sequentially, so make your plan as detailed as possible.\n\n# Guidelines to follow\n- You should pay attention to the user \'s requests during your conversation and come up with a plan that does everything\nthey asked for.\n- Each step of your plan should be properly scoped so that the Modules can execute them successfully . To get a sense of\nwhat a good plan looks like , see Examples . Also see Examples of Good Instructions for instructions the Modules were\nable to carry out correctly . These are good examples to use in each step of your plan .\n- Be flexible in your discussion with the user , but be assertive in each step of your plan . Instead of suggesting\npossible approaches , commit to a single one.\n- Always write very precisely how many objects are should be created.\n- Ask the user questions about the scene. Its important to Ask only one question at a time and then wait for the user input!\n- If you get an image as an input, do not summarize the picture to the user! Only ask one question after another to the user!\n- If you are sure you have all the information needed, end the conversation and reply with the action plan and [Conversation finished].\n\n\n# Examples\n\n# Example\nUser: I want to create a fair booth\nAssistant: Okay! Do you want the fair booth with or without walls?\nUser: I only want one wall in the back of the fair booth\nAssistant: Great, do you want displays or any other specific objects in the fair booth?\nUser: I want 4 displays and add some other nice objects in the fair booth. Present the final plan.\nAssistant:\n- Create a fair booth with one wall in the back and a floor in the middle. The wall should touch the floor just at the corner.\n- Add a 3D registration desk at the entrance of the fair booth give it an appropriate color in RGB. The registration desk stays on the floor at the front of the floor.\n- Place multiple decorative banners from the ceiling of the hall in various colors; each banner can be created using elongated rectangles. Each banner should touch the wall\nfrom the inside of the fair booth. There should be no collision between the wall and the banners.\n- Set up two small tables with each four chairs around the fair booth for visitor seating, then color them in RGB. There should be enough space between the chair and table -> no collision\n- Create quiet zones with padded seating using cushions made from cubes, colored in softer RGB tones. They are on the ground, and there should be enough space between them to walk through them.\n- Create 4 displays centered in the fair booth, colored in bright RGB tones. They are on the floor, with no collision.\n- Incorporate lighting by creating hanging lights from the ceiling using thin cylinders, giving them a yellow tint in RGB for warmth.\n- Finally, scatter some decorations such as balloons flying in the air made from spheres in assorted vibrant colors across the fair booth to create a lively atmosphere.\n- Make sure, there is enough space between the chairs and the tables.\n- Make sure, the 4 displays are rotated to look more appealing\n- Make sure, each chair is facing his table.\n- Ensure there is enough walking space between the registration desk, tables and chairs!\n[Conversation finished]\n\n# Example\nUser: Create a classroom for 20 people, without a ceiling. Be creative with the rest. Start.\nAssistant:\n- Determine the overall classroom room size suitable for 20 people with enough space between desks and aisles.\n- Create 20 student desks as rectangular tables with chairs, arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks. Place all desks and chairs on the floor with clear space between desks.\n- Create a large teacher\'s desk at the front of the room, centered and between the teacher desk and blackboard to face the student desks, placed on the floor.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard/whiteboard on the front wall, placed above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Create a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard/whiteboard.\n- Add a tall bookshelf filled with books along one side wall.\n- Place a circular wall clock on a visible side wall.\n- Create a potted plant in one corner of the room.\n- Design multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced across the room.\n- Put educational posters or charts evenly spaced on the side and back walls.\n- Add waste bins near the teacher\'s desk and at the back of the classroom.\n- Include a large window with curtains on one side wall.\n- Ensure all chairs face towards the front wall.\n- Make sure there is enough walking space between desks and objects, with no collisions.\n- Color the student desks with a light wood tone, teacher desk in a darker wood tone, chairs in a complementary color.\n- Use white or light colors for walls and floor for a bright atmosphere.\n- Create a floor with the right size, that all objects fit into the classroom.\n- Create four walls for the classroom.\n- Do not create a ceiling.\n- Make sure the student desks and chairs face the teacher.\n- Make sure the teacher desk and chair face the students.\n- Position all objects on the floor or mounted on walls/ceiling as appropriate.\n[Conversation finished]\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a classroom.

Height constraint:\n    6.1) ground: on the ground\n    6.2) top: touching the ceiling\n    6.3) air: between the ceiling and the ground\n\nFor each object, you must have one global constraint and you can select various numbers of constraints and any\ncombinations of them and the output format must be: object | global constraint | constraint 1 | constraint 2 | ...\nFor example: sofa-0 | edge\ncoffee table-0 | middle | near, sofa-0 | in front of, sofa-0 | center aligned, sofa-0 | face to, sofa-0\ntv stand-0 | edge | far, coffee table-0 | in front of, coffee table-0 | center aligned, coffee table-0 | face to,\ncoffee table-0\nflying car-0 | middle| far, coffee table-0 | flying top air\n\nHere are some guidelines for you:\n1. I will use your guideline to arrange the objects *iteratively*, so please start with an anchor object which doesn’t\ndepend on the other objects (with only one global constraint).\n2. Place the larger objects first.\n3. The latter objects could only depend on the former objects.\n4. The objects of the *same type* are usually *aligned*.\n5. There are usually no objects on top of the walls. With "one a wall" is usually meant -> on the side of a wall.\n6. Chairs must be placed near to the table/desk and face to the table/desk.\n\nPlease keep going until the users query is completely resolved, before ending your turn.\n    '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nHere are the objects that I want to place: ['teacherDesk', 'blackboard', 'rug', 'studentDesk1', 'studentDesk2', 'studentDesk3', 'studentDesk4', 'studentDesk5', 'studentDesk6', 'studentDesk7', 'studentDesk8', 'studentDesk9', 'studentDesk10', 'studentDesk11', 'studentDesk12', 'studentDesk13', 'studentDesk14', 'studentDesk15', 'bookshelf', 'studentChair1', 'studentChair2', 'studentChair3', 'studentChair4', 'studentChair5', 'studentChair6', 'studentChair7', 'studentChair8', 'studentChair9', 'studentChair10', 'studentChair11', 'studentChair12', 'studentChair13', 'studentChair14', 'studentChair15', 'teacherChair', 'window1', 'window2', 'curtain1', 'curtain2', 'poster1', 'poster2', 'poster3', 'poster4', 'poster5', 'poster6', 'projector', 'wallClock', 'pottedPlant_pot', 'pottedPlant_plant', 'wasteBin1', 'wasteBin2', 'ceilingLight1', 'ceilingLight2', 'ceilingLight3', 'ceilingLight4', 'ceilingLight5', 'ceilingLight6', 'northWall', 'southWall', 'eastWall', 'westWall', 'floor']\nHere are the relations that I want to create: Arrange the objects in the classroom: \n1.

I then arrange the 15 student desks in the middle area in three rows of five: each row shares a central anchor aligned to the floor and uses side-of spacing for columns and far-spacing for rows. Student chairs go near each desk, facing the front wall. The teacher desk and chair sit at the front center, also facing students. Wall-mounted items—the blackboard on the front wall, windows and curtains on the right wall, bookshelf on the left wall, and wall clock on the back wall—are added next. Finally, the projector hangs from the ceiling center, the rug lies in the central aisle, ceiling lights are placed near each wall, posters are mounted at eye level, and a potted plant and waste bins occupy designated corners.

Steps:\n1. Instantiate the floor at (0,0,0) with scale (10, 0.01, 7).\n2. Instantiate the four walls at room edges with appropriate positions and scales.\n3. Instantiate 15 student desks and 15 chairs arranged in 3 rows of 5 with designated spacing and rotations (chairs facing the front wall).\n4. Instantiate the teacher desk and chair at the front center, with the chair facing the student desks.\n5. Add the blackboard on the front wall, positioned and scaled correctly.\n6. Mount the projector on the ceiling center, oriented toward the blackboard.\n7. Add two windows and corresponding curtains on the right wall, correctly rotated and positioned.\n8. Place the tall bookshelf against the left wall.\n9. Mount the wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n10. Place a potted plant in the front right corner near the windows, pot on the floor and plant above.\n11. Lay out the rug in the middle aisle.\n12. Position six ceiling lights evenly spaced near the perimeter of the ceiling.\n13. Mount six educational posters evenly on the side and back walls at eye level.\n14. Place two waste bins: one near the teacher desk and one at the back center.\nEnsure no collisions, all objects rest on the floor or are mounted on walls/ceiling, and all chairs face the front wall.\n\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor | middle | height: ground\', \'northWall | back\', \'southWall | front\', \'eastWall | side, right\', \'westWall | side, left\',

Steps:\n1. Instantiate the floor at (0,0,0) with scale (10, 0.01, 7).\n2. Instantiate the four walls at room edges with appropriate positions and scales.\n3. Instantiate 15 student desks and 15 chairs arranged in 3 rows of 5 with designated spacing and rotations (chairs facing the front wall).\n4. Instantiate the teacher desk and chair at the front center, with the chair facing the student desks.\n5. Add the blackboard on the front wall, positioned and scaled correctly.\n6. Mount the projector on the ceiling center, oriented toward the blackboard.\n7. Add two windows and corresponding curtains on the right wall, correctly rotated and positioned.\n8. Place the tall bookshelf against the left wall.\n9. Mount the wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n10. Place a potted plant in the front right corner near the windows, pot on the floor and plant above.\n11. Lay out the rug in the middle aisle.\n12. Position six ceiling lights evenly spaced near the perimeter of the ceiling.\n13. Mount six educational posters evenly on the side and back walls at eye level.\n14. Place two waste bins: one near the teacher desk and one at the back center.\nEnsure no collisions, all objects rest on the floor or are mounted on walls/ceiling, and all chairs face the front wall.\n\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor | middle | height: ground\', \'northWall | back\', \'southWall | front\', \'eastWall | side, right\', \'westWall | side, left\',

Instantiate 15 student desks and 15 chairs arranged in 3 rows of 5 with designated spacing and rotations (chairs facing the front wall).\n4. Instantiate the teacher desk and chair at the front center, with the chair facing the student desks.\n5. Add the blackboard on the front wall, positioned and scaled correctly.\n6. Mount the projector on the ceiling center, oriented toward the blackboard.\n7. Add two windows and corresponding curtains on the right wall, correctly rotated and positioned.\n8. Place the tall bookshelf against the left wall.\n9. Mount the wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n10. Place a potted plant in the front right corner near the windows, pot on the floor and plant above.\n11. Lay out the rug in the middle aisle.\n12. Position six ceiling lights evenly spaced near the perimeter of the ceiling.\n13. Mount six educational posters evenly on the side and back walls at eye level.\n14. Place two waste bins: one near the teacher desk and one at the back center.\nEnsure no collisions, all objects rest on the floor or are mounted on walls/ceiling, and all chairs face the front wall.\n\n\n            Use these relations for the objects: [\'floor | middle | height: ground\', \'northWall | back\', \'southWall | front\', \'eastWall | side, right\', \'westWall | side, left\',

- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

[2025-05-17 14:10:55,950] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a medium-sized rectangular classroom room size suitable for approximately 15 students with enough walking space between furniture.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

[2025-05-17 14:13:36,640] INFO: Input Wall Action Plan:  - Determine a medium-sized rectangular classroom room size suitable for approximately 15 students with enough walking space between furniture.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

students with enough walking space between furniture.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.\n- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.\n- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.\n- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.\n- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.\n- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.\n- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.\n- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.\n- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.\n- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.\n- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 14:14:07,600] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a medium-sized rectangular classroom room size suitable for approximately 15 students with enough walking space between furniture.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

students with enough walking space between furniture.\n- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.\n- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.\n- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.\n- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.\n- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.\n- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.\n- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.\n- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.\n- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.\n- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.\n- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'function_call': 'auto', 'functions': [{'name': 'validate_scene', 'description': 'Validates the unity scene.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'IssueReport': {'properties': {'objectName': {'description': 'Name of the object', 'title': 'Objectname', 'type': 'string'}, 'path': {'description': 'Hierarchy path', 'title': 'Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'issue': {'description': 'Issue Description', 'title': 'Issue', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggestedFix': {'description': 'Suggested Fix', 'title': 'Suggestedfix', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['objectName', 'path', 'issue', 'suggestedFix'], 'title': 'IssueReport', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'issueReports': {'anyOf': [{'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/IssueReport'}, 'type': 'array'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'The Issue Reports', 'title': 'Issuereports'}, 'noImprovementSuggestions': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'description': 'No suggestions for improvement', 'title': 'Noimprovementsuggestions'}}, 'required': ['issueReports', 'noImprovementSuggestions'], 'title': 'ValidatorResponse', 'type': 'object'}}], 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}

[2025-05-17 14:17:15,091] INFO: Input Action Plan:  - Determine a medium-sized rectangular classroom room size suitable for approximately 15 students with enough walking space between furniture.
- Create 15 student desks arranged in 3 rows of 5 desks. Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.
- Create a teacher's desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.
- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher's desk.
- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.
- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.
- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.
- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.
- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.
- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.
- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.
- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.
- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.
- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.
- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.
- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.
- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.
- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.
- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.

Each desk is a rectangular table with an accompanying chair, placed on the floor with adequate walking space between desks.\n- Create a teacher\'s desk larger than student desks, placed at the front center of the classroom facing the student desks, with a comfortable chair.\n- Add a large rectangular blackboard on the front wall, positioned above and behind the teacher\'s desk.\n- Place a ceiling-mounted projector aligned with the blackboard, placed near the middle of the ceiling.\n- Create four walls around the classroom and a floor but no ceiling.\n- Add two large windows on one side wall to allow natural light to enter, with simple curtains.\n- Place a tall bookshelf filled with books against the opposite side wall from the windows.\n- Add a circular wall clock above the door on the back wall.\n- Create a potted plant in a corner near the windows for a natural touch.\n- Include a rectangular rug in the middle aisle between student rows for warmth.\n- Add multiple ceiling lights evenly spaced on the ceiling perimeter for uniform lighting.\n- Place educational posters and charts evenly along the side and back walls.\n- Put two waste bins: one near the teacher’s desk and one at the back of the classroom.\n- Ensure all student chairs face towards the front wall and blackboard.\n- Ensure the teacher’s chair faces the student desks.\n- Use light wood tones for desks and chairs, with complementary soft colors for the walls and floor to create a bright, welcoming environment.\n- Position all objects so they rest comfortably on the floor or mount appropriately on walls/ceiling.\n- Make sure there is no collision between objects and enough space for free movement within the classroom.\n[Conversation finished]These are the issue reports:\n[{\'objectName\': \'Window1 & Window2\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Window1, ClassroomScene/Window2\', \'issue\': \'Both Window1 and Window2 intersect with the thickness of RightWall (they embed into the wall volume).\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.x to 4.85 for both windows (Window1→[4.85, 1.5, -1], Window2→[4.85, 1.5, 1]) so they sit flush with the interior face of the wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Curtain1_Left, Curtain1_Right, Curtain2_Left, Curtain2_Right\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene\', \'issue\': \'All curtains are too thick and intersect with the wall/window volumes.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reduce thickness on all curtains by changing Scale to [0.1, 1.6, 0.1] (was [0.1, 1.6, 1.6]) so they no longer collide with the wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Door\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Door\', \'issue\': \'Door cube overlaps the BackWall thickness and is embedded in the wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move Position.z to -3.85 (was -4.001) to place the door flush with the interior face of the back wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Clock\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Clock\', \'issue\': \'Clock intersects the BackWall/door region and is partially inside the wall.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Position.z to -3.85 (was -3.9) so it sits just in front of the wall surface.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Blackboard\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Blackboard\', \'issue\': \'Blackboard panel intersects the FrontWall thickness.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move Position.z to 3.85 (was 3.9) so it sits flush against the interior face of the front wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Bookshelf\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Bookshelf\', \'issue\': \'Bookshelf cube overlaps with the LeftWall volume.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move Position.x to -4.75 (was -4.9) so it sits flush with the interior face of the left wall.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'TeacherChair\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/TeacherChair\', \'issue\': \'TeacherChair is rotated away from the student desks (faces -Z) and positioned too far from the desk front.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Set Rotation to [0, 0, 0] and Position to [0, 0.6, 2.1] (was [0, 0.6, 2.0]) so it faces +Z toward the students and sits directly at the desk front.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Projector\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Projector\', \'issue\': \'Projector is slightly below the intended ceiling plane.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Raise Position.y to 3.0 (was 2.9) so it is flush with the ceiling height.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Rug\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene/Rug\', \'issue\': \'Rug plane spans the entire room instead of covering just the central aisle.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Reduce Scale.z to 2.5 (was 4) so the rug spans only the walkway between student desk rows.\'}, {\'objectName\': \'Student desks & chairs in columns 1 & 5\', \'path\': \'ClassroomScene\', \'issue\': \'The outermost student desks and chairs (columns 1 & 5) sit only 0.3 m from the walls, which may be tight for walking.\', \'suggestedFix\': \'Move X positions of all Column 1 objects from -4 to -3.8, and Column 5 objects from 4 to 3.8 (chairs and desks) to increase clearance to ~0.5 m.\'}]'}], 'model': 'o4-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'high'}}
